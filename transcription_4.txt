    Please hold while I try to connect you. Thank you for calling home insurance agency. This is Orlando speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? Hello? Hello. Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for calling one insurance agency. This is Orlando. Are you calling in for health insurance today? I am with the Affordable Care act. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. That's what we do here at our agency. We help individuals get qualified through the Affordable Care act, which is an Obamacare health market plan. And we basically run an application for you and then discuss the different carriers for you at the end. Okay. All right. And can I have your first name and last name? Natalie Hawkins. All right, Natalie Hawkins. Let me go ahead and start recording this call. This call is being recorded. Natalie, just for the record, this call is being recorded for quality purposes. Today is August 22, 2024 30 06:00 p.m. and pleasure to meet you. My name is Orlando. And, Natalie, may I have your date of birth, please, and the state you're calling me from? I'm calling from Florida. My date of birth is 1117 1987. Okay, awesome. I'm in Miami, by the way, so I'm not sure where you're calling me from. Okay, you're about 4 hours down the road, down nine. Are you in Orlando? Where are you at? You're about. I'm in Daytona and Daytona beach. Okay. So yeah, you're a little bit of north. Awesome. Yeah, you're about four or four and a half hours from me if you're depending on what, where in Miami you are not from down there. They say that Miami starts in Coconut Creek or. That's. That's for me. That's a through up north. Yep. Now I'm in the Kendall. Kendall area. That's where we're at. We work out of Doral. I live in Kendall. Okay, so you're right by the airport? Okay, right, right by the airport. Yep. Yeah, right up. My aunt lives in Kendall. Awesome. Awesome, Natalie. So what I'll do is I'll run an application for you here, and then at the end of this call, I'll give you my phone number with the name of my agency and my contact information, and then we can start putting some carriers out for you. So I'm going to enter your information into the marketplace. It's a private website. Everything is safe there. I have. You have Natalie Hawkis, H a w k I s. Birthday, 1117 1987. Female. The next two pieces of information that they will be asking me. First is first your Social Security number and then for your address when you're ready. Okay. You said any my social? Yes, ma'am. Would they not be able to pull my social? No, we're, we're applying for a marketplace plan, so we have to enter your information. You're running an application? Okay. Zero. It's not like a credit pool or anything like that? No, no, there's no, no, no, no. There's no, no. That. We would need your consent for that. Absolutely not. You're applying for an Obamacare health plan. And what we do is we take your information, your salary, all your personal information, we put it into the system. I work with all the carriers. Ambed or Blue cross, Florida blue, cigna, aetna, United Healthcare, Molina, Oscar. We find you the best possible plan and we're going to review those different carriers. At the end of the call, if what you hear you like, we register you there. I give you my information. I'm going to be sending you an email with the plan details and the eligibility form, which you're also going to get in the mail directly from the carrier along with your id cards that are going to come in in about two weeks. They usually take about seven to ten business days. With that, I send you an email with a screenshot that has the phone number to the carrier that you and I choose at the end of this call. And you said I received plan b pills in the mail? No, not plan B. Your. Your plan details and your agenda ability form. That's basically all the plan b. No, it's not plan b. It's all the details from the carrier. No, no. The plan details is something that, you know, the plan details is something that I will be sending you at the end of the email. In the email. I like to do that as a courtesy for my clients because you get it in the mail from the carrier in about two weeks. But it's always nice for you to review what you're enrolling yourself into instead of having to wait two weeks. Right. I mean, I kind of want to do it, but I don't know. I'm like kind of skeptical because I never heard about it before. Well, it's Obamacare. It's a health plan with the Affordable Care act with the marketplace. Okay, so are you looking for. Are you looking for health coverage? Do you need health insurance? Yeah, I need health insurance because I don't accept. I don't have Medicaid. Okay. Oh, I do. I need health insurance. So. Okay, that's probably because you're probably. Are you currently working right now? Well, I was working and sorry, but I was working, but my store was closed down and it was bought out of, so everybody lost the job. So you all terminated. And like I said, I have applied for food stamps and cash assistance and Medicaid, but I was never approved for the Medicaid. Okay. Nor the cat. How long ago did. How long ago did this happen? Like, oh, six months ago. Okay. So they should have been. Let me get it. Okay. Yeah. So I can qualify. So, Natalie, I can go ahead and qualify you for a health plan, because you have something called a loss qualifying event, where you lost cardinal, whether it's through Medicaid, Medicare, the marketplace, or through your employer. Like I said, we would run an application for you, and then once we run an application for you, we qualify you for health coverage. It's that simple. It's that easy. Do you have a pen and paper handy with you? I have my phone and I got notes, so. Okay, go to the notes. Okay. So go ahead and take down my information. My name is Orlando. My last name is Rodriguez. My phone number is the one I'm calling you from now, the 561-363-6519 and I'll give you my license number as well. My license number is 2079-7253 I don't know what I did, but the whole thing just went blank. Oh, no, it's okay. I'll send you all that information. Yeah, I'll send you all that information via email at the end, all with the attachments and everything else that you need. So I'm here to help you get started. If you'd like to run an application with me, we can do that together over the phone. Okay. All right. Would you like to move forward and proceed? Yeah, that's fine. All right. Natalie. Natalie. I'm a Floridian. Trust me, I know. I'm on the other side of the line. Your information is going to be safe with us. It's going into a system. There's no data breach. We're not running your credit, nothing. We're going to help you get some healthcare. I promise you that. And then I'm going to give you my info, because somebody else is on the other line. I'm like, well, how the hell? No. Yeah, yeah. What they. What? That's our call center. Basically, what they do is they ask you a few questions to see if you pre qualify. That way, when you get to me, quote unquote, and I say this respectfully, they don't waste their time. If you don't pre qualify for a health plan, then there's no reason to get you over to me who's a licensed agent. So once that those reps feel like, hey, Natalie qualifies, let's get them over to a licensed agent. You land with my agency, and we're here right now. Right. So I'll move forward, and then, you know, you can provide me your information. I have first name, Natalie. N a t a l I e. Last name Hawkins. H a w k I s. Yes. A date of birth of 1117 1987. Correct? Yes. And just for the record, I have to ask, do you identify yourself, gender wise, as a male or female? Female. Female. Okay. And then when you're ready, I would need your Social Security number to proceed, please. 044-86-3246 okay, so I have 044-86-3246 yes. And the next piece of information that I would need would be your street address, your home address. 353 Folsom. F u l t o NDA. I'm sorry, how do you spell that? Pardon me? S u l t o n street. Fulton street. Excellent. Is there an apartment associated with it or. Or not? No. The house and. And the city would be Daytona. Yes. Daytona beach. Perfect. Florida. And your zip code, Natalie? 321143. I'm sorry, you were breaking up there a little bit. Say again? 3321-143-2114 excellent. And I have Volusia county. Yes, I've never. I've always driven by Daytona beach when I go to Orlando, but I've never been in Daytona beach itself. Right. It's a wave. I'm so sticky. Natalie, give me a valid email address where I can send you all these details at the end of the call. What would be your email? Naymar eight@hotmail.com. okay, bear with me and have some patience here. I just want to verify I got it correct. I have n as in November, a as in Alpha, y as in yo yo, m as in Mary, a as in Alpha, r as in Romeo, I as in India. Yes. Okay, so it's neymary zero eight@hotmail.com. correct. Hello. Yes. Okay. Is the email correct, Natalie? Yes. Okay, perfect. And, Natalie, you will be receiving paper notices in the mail from the health plan that you and I choose to here at the end of the call. Just bear with me 1 second. Natalie, I'm here. Are you there? Yes, I'm here. Yep. Okay, so 1 second. Here it looks. Now that I've entered your social, I'm not sure if you've entered your information into any type of link anywhere out there on social media or whatnot, but it seems that with your social, it's populating that you have an application already. I'm not sure if you're aware of that or not. No. Okay. It was popular. Yeah. It was showing with Oscar health insurance. Hello? Natalie? Yes. Are you there with me? Yes. So it was populating that you already have a health plan with Oscar health insurance. I'm not sure if you're aware of that health plan or that agent that has you enrolled. No, not at all. Where are they located? I have absolutely no idea. No, they're not. And that. That's probably somebody who did grab your information and enrolled you into a health plan without your knowledge, because you should know whether you have a health plan or not and who that agent is working with you on the other side. The only way I can get this fixed for you, Natalie, is we can do a three way call with the marketplace, and the marketplace will verify your identity. And then you would give them your permission for me to become your agent of record moving forward, and that way you only deal with me. Would you like to do that? Hello? That's fine. That's fine. All right, give me 1 second. Don't hang up. Let me put them on a three way. This call is being reported on the line after you speak with a representative to complete a brief automated survey. Natalie, I'm back. Give me 1 second. All of our representatives are currently assisting other callers. Please stay on the line and our next available representative will assist you. Your estimated wait time is less than 1 minute. Natalie, are you there? Thank you for calling marketplace. My name is Brandy Spence. How may I assist? Hey, Brandy, how are you doing? My name is Orlando. I have a new client here on the phone with me. Her name is Natalie. Natalie, are you presently there? Yes, I'm here. Okay. Yes, ma'am. So the reason for our call is Natalie called in for health insurance. We're here stationed out of Florida. My name is Orlando Rodriguez. I am on a recorded line. My MPN license number is 2079-7253 I was explaining to her what the Affordable Care act is and how it works, and I was trying to help her out by finding some health insurance. So she gave me her permission, of course, to search for in the marketplace. And upon doing so, I ran into the fact that she already has a health plan with Oscar, with an agent, and she had no idea she had Oscar health plan. She has absolutely no idea who that agent is. So she wants to basically verify her identity here and then give me permission to be her agent moving forward. That way she knows what health plan she has and who her agent is moving forward, etcetera. So I have her here on the line. Okay? So I'd be happy to assist. Before we get started, ma'am, can I have your last name? I'm sorry, my love. Say that again. Can I have your last name? Hawkins. Hawkins. And your first name? Natalie. N a t a l I e. Natalie. Yes, that was correct. N a t a l I e. Okay, and your date of birth? 1117 87. One moment. Did you say eleven seven, 8711 17. Okay, and your address with the city, state and zip code? 353 Fulton Street, Daytona Beach, Florida, 32114. All right, bear with me just a moment. And, ma'am, as we verify, Natalie, and you push that application over to my side. I like to help her out by. By launching out a fraud case against that agent? I don't like it when agents are enrolling individuals and they don't even know they're being enrolled. She had no idea she even had a health plan. She doesn't know who this agent. Yeah. And then the other thing I would like to do, she's never heard of them, and. And I just want to. Give me. Give me. Yeah, 1 second. And what I would like to do for her as well, because we're going to spend ten minutes on this call, but I don't want to have her call anymore. I don't want to waste your time, but I would definitely like to cancel that plan because she's going to get hit on her tax return for a plan she didn't even know, and that's not fair to her. So in a way, to protect her and protect her tax return, I like to cancel that plan. And then I would enroll her in a different plan, which was a better option, and I'll get with her offline to discuss that as her agent of record. So I understand that you want to do all that, but the thing is, I need to make a new car record for her. So just a moment. Bear with me before I do this. How did you say that you spelled your last name, ma'am? H a w k I n s. Okay. Could you go over your Social Security number with me? You have it, I'll confirm it. That's what I'm saying. I can't. I can't say it. Yeah, could you go over it for me? It's 044-86-3246 okay, so you see it as what it reads? Yeah. What's that? Lay down a shoe. Oh, goodness. Bear with me, guys. Okay, so I see something. Do you give me permission to speak freely on this phone call, ma'am? Yeah, go ahead. Okay, so I see something. The name is spelled wrong, but we do have you verified everything else that I could get you to verify? But the name is spelled wrong, the last name is spelled without an NDE, and there is a 2024 application there. You want to do an authorization for this gentleman that's on the phone to be able to call into the marketplace and make changes without you on the phone? No. Is that correct? No. Yeah. Natalie, so, what? She's asking you for my social without me being present? What is that? No, not at all. You only want. You only want to be authorized as long as he's. Or as long as you're on the phone with him. Correct? Okay. Yeah. Why would he speak on my social or my name without me, without knowing that doesn't exist? Then he would have all that information that you have presented to him, but that just gets him permission to call the marketplace when you're, like, busy at work or something like that. If something needs to be updated, I mean. Yeah, he's authorized representative. I don't understand. Okay, so let me jump in here. Natalie, it's totally up to you. What she's asking is, we have at my agency, we have your information. If we ever need to make an update on your application or anything of that manner, we would have to go through this whole process again. Or you can give me authority for 365 days, which is one year, and basically, we can call the marketplace on your behalf and represent you. It's totally up to you how you want to handle that. Usually my clients, they give us the authority for 365 days. That way, we represent you. What I'm doing as your agent of record is I'm representing you concerning your health plan. Okay, so, guys, I want to interrupt you guys for just a second. Now, I did put in there that you gave me verbal permission to speak freely on this call today. Your special enrollment period ends today. So you can change plans at any time with this application until the end of today. Unless something. When we go back through the application, if something changes to give you an extension on that special enrollment period, then that would be okay. But who is supposed to be agent of record? It's gonna be our agency, ma'am. The first name of the agency owner, it's Karen Karin. The last name is Sagastigi. And I can spell that out for you if you need to. Yeah, go ahead. Sagastegui. And e S p e j o. Segaste. Gazpejo. And the license number NPN number is 2097-9642 okay, so we're just picking a different plan for her. Is that correct? I want to review. I want escalation for fraud and all that. No problem. Yeah, I mean, if you want to. Right now? Yeah, let me. Let me. Let me see. Yeah, let me. What we need you to do is just push the agent of record over to us, and then what we're going to do with. With her offline is I'm going to review the different carriers because she's got different options in her zip code, and I want to make sure we pick the best one for her. Okay? So that's all I have left to do, is pick a plan. You've already changed the agent of record. Okay, perfect. The agent of record should be changed when you submit the application. However, you have to be on a three way call to push the enrollment through. Well, that's what we're. That's why we're here. I have to be on the phone with you? Yeah, pick the plan, and I have to be the one to push and roll. Yep, go ahead. So do you want to go over the plans with her and me, just sit here on the line while you guys go over them? Or do you want me to go over them? No, you can go ahead, and. You can go ahead and do it. That's fine. Okay, ma'am. So, when you're looking for insurance, what matters the most to you? Like, is it your monthly premium, or is it when you go to the doctor or your deductible, what means the most? And then give me what means the most down to what means the least to you in an insurance that I just went over. Hello? Hello? Hello? Yeah, Natalie, are you there? Okay, she may have gotten disconnected. I mean, if anything, just push the application through to the same plan, and then, you know, I'll call her back and get with her. On what. What other plans we can choose before the end of day. You can go over the application with me. Okay. But I can't go on with this call without her on the phone. Why is that? Because she only gave me permission to be on the phone with you with her on the phone. Okay. All right, no problem. Thank you. You can call her back with me on three ways. Yeah, let's try that. The caller has disconnected the line. Goodbye.
