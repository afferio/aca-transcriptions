All right, I'm going to need a few questions from you. Give me 1 second. Okay. I need your first name. I do need to let you know that since this is a government insurance healthcare plan, they are going to require. The marketplace is going to require your first name, last name, date of birth, the state that you live in, and your Social Security number, full address. Are you comfortable with that? I'm comfortable with majority of it. I'm not comfortable with my Social Security number due to the fact that I have suffered from identity fraud. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. For me to be able to create an application form for you, I'm sorry, I do. That's one of the requirements. It won't let me keep going forward. If I cannot obtain your Social Security number. I'm sorry. It's a. It's a. Thank you. So thank you. Okay.
