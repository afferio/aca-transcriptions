Let me put this here. All right, give me 1 second. Okay. Now, at the end of this call, I will recommend for you not to give your information out to anybody else. I don't care if you see an ad that says, oh, we'll give you a free gift card. A free. This. All they want to do is take information, throw in the marketplace, and I tell all my clients, please do not fall for that. They are not going to offer you anything better than what I'm offering you right now. This is a government healthcare plan. They tell you they're going to give you a gift card. That is not true. So you have to be very careful with that, not give your information to other agents, because then what they do is just throw you in the marketplace. And I have clients that have gone through that and I told them, well, I told you not to do that. Unfortunately, especially with everything that's going on right now, you don't want to go into that part of giving your information out. Okay? So just so you're aware, you know, your information, stay with me. This is not for me. This is for the government at the end of the day. But if you do see any ads stating that they're going to give you a gift card, that is. That is false information, unfortunately. Okay. So just be very careful with that. All right. So next question is, are you married? No. Okay. Do you plan to file federal income tax return for 2024? Yes. Awesome. Are you claiming any dependent on your taxes for 2024? No. All right, perfect. Will you be claiming as a tax dependent by someone else for 2024? No. All right. All right. Give me 1 second, then continue here. All right. Are you a us citizen? Yes. Okay, perfect. Are you currently incarcerated, detained or jailed? No. Okay. Are you an american Indian or alaskan Native American. Okay. But are you an american Indian? No. Okay. Okay, perfect. That's. Okay. Now, the marketplace is going to require for you to have what is your, you would say is your annual salary, income 15,000. All right, so just so you know, in the state of Florida, for you to qualify, it has to be at least 16,000. It could be a little bit less like you're making 15,000, you stated, or it could be 16 to 17,000. It can't be any more than that because if not, then it's just basically it's gonna shoot you another direction. And, you know, we're actually trying to get you a free health care plan. Okay. I'm just letting you know. So I'm putting in between 15 to 16. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. So now, okay, so do you have Medicaid, Medicare, the va? No. Okay, perfect. All right, we're almost done. Okay. Now are you gonna get me. No, it's okay. You could ask. I can help you. It's okay. Are you going to get back to me using my phone number? Well, no, what I'm going to do is, okay, so this is, I'm going to give you my phone number as well. Okay. So after I'm done doing this with your healthcare, I'm going to give you my phone number. You are going to be able to call me. If you say, hey, Karen, you know, there's some changes. I want this and that. No problem. I do have to state, by the way, today's date is Auguste 26, 2014 01:55 p.m. eastern time. I'm going to give you my information. You can call me if you want to change something in your plan. You say, hey, I don't like this, I don't like that. I can help you with that. I will also send you an email with your plan and you'll be receiving your card, your healthcare plan card, your insurance card through the mail. It will take around five to seven business days for it to come. But either way, I will send you an email with all of the details of your insurance. Okay, so it's the same email, the same information that I'm going to send you by email, the same exact information you're going to have in your card, okay? Mm hmm. So here I'm looking upon the carriers, and normally they. The marketplace will send you to the best ones that appear in the top. So I see here an ambetter plan. It's standard silver. Your monthly premium will be zero. Deductible will be zero. Your doctor's visit is $0. A specialist, such as a cardiologist, if you have to go see a psychologist, whatever, the specialist, an OBG. An OBG, then that would only be a cost of $10. And genetic drug, which is any prescription that they may give you, your doctor, your PCP, it's at no charge. This is the best plan right now that I have. Would you like to be enrolled to this plan? Yeah, sure. All right. It's an unbetter plan. So you don't pay for your doctor's visit. You don't pay for any genetic drug, which is medication, and to visit a specialist, you only pay $10, which I think that's amazing. Okay. Yeah, me, too. I hope it's not too good to be true. No, it's not. Trust me, it depends. Everything depends on the person's zip code, on the zip code of the location. That's according to what the marketplace pulls the information. So you got a really good plan, Christine. I've helped people out in Florida, too. I have clients in Florida, and this is by far one of the best plants I've seen. Okay, great. All right, perfect. So now I'm going to give you my name. My name is Karen. K a r I nde. And the phone number that you can reach out to me, which, by the way, it's also going to be included in your e, in the email, I'm going to send you right now. As soon as I hang up, I'm going to send you your plan through mail. I'm sorry. Through email. And it's going to my phone number, and the agency I work with will be there as well. So just in case, you will have it in the email. Okay? So the phone number that you can reach out to me is 506 1363-6519 okay, that's 561503. Or five, six, three. No, no, no, it's 561-363-6519 okay. 561-563-6517 no, no, no, I'm going to repeat it again. Okay, it's five, six, one. Okay. 363-6519 okay, I got it. Awesome. All right, so now. So like I said, christine, please do not give your information out to anybody, okay? No. If you see ads and they call you, you tell them, I already have an agent. I don't need that. Thank you very much. And you hang up because what they're going to try to do is your information and throw in the marketplace, and that's what I don't want to happen. Okay. If you have any questions, any doubts, please feel free to either email me or just give me a call, and I'll be more than happy to help you. You can also shoot a text message. Okay. Okay. All right, christine, thank you very much. That's about it. And now you just have your ambetter healthcare plan, you, no payment for your pcp or for genetic drugs. And if you have to see a specialist, you're only gonna pay $10, which is amazing. Okay. All right. That's about it. Christine, thank you very much. And I will send you an email as soon as we hang up. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much, karen. Oh, thank you, christine. You have a wonderful day. Okay? You as well. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you. Bye.
