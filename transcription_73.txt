    Connect you. Thank you for calling mall insurance, a third party of the marketplace. My name is Orlando, a certified agent. Are you calling in for health insurance today? Yeah. Because you called me. Yes. Okay, and are you looking for health insurance, sir? Yes, I do. Have you? I'm looking for a better one. All right, so you have health insurance right now? Yeah, but I'm looking for a better one. I don't know if you can hook me up. I don't know about hooking you up, but, um, are you right now, do you have Medicaid, Medicare, or a marketplace plan or insurance? Marketplace. Okay. Yeah, so we work with the marketplace, too. So if you already have insurance, I can't help you. I'm sorry. Okay. Thank you.
