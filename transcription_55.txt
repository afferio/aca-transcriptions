    Try to connect you. Thank you for calling the enrollment insurance agency, a third party of the marketplace. Are you calling in concerning health insurance? Yes. Okay. And how are you today? Good afternoon. I'm tired. I keep getting all these phone calls. I'm sorry. Well, they usually transfer you over to us if you're looking for health insurance plan. I can get you quoted and insured in about seven minutes, and we can knock it out quick if you're interested. Charged anything? Because I don't make anything enough to pay for insurance. We can pre qualify. You just follow my lead here. What is your first name and last name? Michelle Franco. Michelle. And where are you calling me from, Michelle? What state? Texas. Texas. All right. And what is your date of birth? 3490. 3490. And these are the qualified pre qualifying, pre qualifying questions. Sorry about that. Are you currently on Medicaid, Medicare, the VA, or Tricare or any other type of health insurance? No, I'm not. Okay. And are you currently working and earning at least $16,000 a year in the state of Texas? I came part time, but it's not even. It's like, maybe one day a week, and I don't even get. I mean, maybe I've made this past year, like, a little bit less than 17,000. Okay, we can go with 16,000, and that's fine. Now, I will have to search you in the marketplace just to verify, because when I did input you here, I have 123456 plans that came up with your name, so I would need to verify with your social just to make sure that those plans are not active. Would you care to share your Social Security number just to verify you don't have an active enrollment? I won't share my social with anybody. I've already had identities up top. They're still fixing that. No problem, ma'am. Like I said, you're signing up for health insurance with anyone that you sign health insurance with. Blue Cross, United, Cigna. Just like car insurance. They're going to need your identity. Right? Your Social Security number is part of it, so you can't get approved for a government based plan or even a private plan without inputting your social. But if you're not comfortable, then we won't be able to move forward. Okay. All right. I'm sorry about that. Thank you. No problem. Thank you.
