All right, so the marketplace does require an annual income. So what would you say? It's your annual income? Like, just a. It'd be between. It'd be between 14 and 16,000? Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay. Sounds like your baby wants to go outside or something. Oh, no, they. They bark for everything. They literally bark. I have a Bernie doodle and a goldfish, so. They bark. They see a squirrel, they bark. They see the mailman. They bark. Yeah. I have kitty babies. I grew up with a lot of my parents. We had a lot of cats and we actually had dogs, and they got along very well. Yeah. I have one. I call her bug because I have. She's five months old, and I have fed her from a syringe from the day she was born. From the day she was born. And whenever she was, her eyes, her eyes were so big. They were, like, bigger than her head. It seemed like they were just, like, real bugged out. I call her bug. I call her my cutie bug. That's my baby. That is so cute. She's solid black, and she's got the prettiest green eye. That is so cute. I live in a small town, so she's like, a little, like, store to store. I go to. She's like a little mascot because I carry her everywhere I go. When she was little, I used to carry her in a coach bag, and, like, that's her coach bag, and I took her everywhere, and then they were so everybody's like, where's bug? Where's bug? That is so cute. That's nice. Aw. And she's only five months, you said? Yes, ma'am, she's only five. She just turned five last month, or five months old last month. Oh, my gosh. That's. That's cute. Yeah, I'm an animal person, too. I'll tell her at night. Yeah, I am. I tell her a night. I said, okay, cute bug, it's time to go night night. And she'll run up here and she'll jump on my bed, and she'll lay on her blanket, and she'll lay her head on my shoulder, and she'll go to sleep. Oh, he's my baby. All right, that's sweet. Okay, now we're synchronizing. Okay. Okay, so these, these are the plans. Normally, the marketplace puts the. The providers that are of best based on your zip code. It gives you certain carriers. So the best one that I see for you right now is crisis healthcare plan. It's a standard silver. You won't be charged for any doctor visit. There's no charge. Specialist is only $10. Specialist is a cardiologist, a psychiatrist that you have to go see. And then your genetic drug, which is your medication, is no charge. Your deductible is zero. Okay. Monthly premium. Yeah. And would I get a card in the mail? So. Correct. You will be receiving your insurance card between seven to ten business days. But either way, I'm going to email you your healthcare plan, which is the same information you're going to find in your card. But I'm going to email you after this call, and you're going to be able to see your whole. Your plan. And if you have any questions, any concerns, you could just. I'm going to give you my phone number so you can give me a call. Yeah, I was going to say I just call you back. Yeah, yeah. That would be. If there's any changes that you need, you have to just let me know, and I'll be more than happy to help you. So right now, this is the best plan in the market for your area code. And would you like to enroll into this plan? Yes, ma'am. Okay, great. All right. What plan is that? This is my office manager here. This is crisis. It's one of the best plans that we found for her area code. Where is she located in Louisiana? Well, she has that plan, and. And she has a blue cross blue shield. But don't put her in Blue Cross Blue Shield, Louisiana, because when they go to the doctor with Blue Cross Blue Shield or they do anything, they never pay and they end up charging the client instead of that. So for Louisiana Blue Cross Shield and Romeo, is there any other option here? No, it's just that one. And that's the best plan. Yeah, I already did. I let her know what, so she won't be paying for her PCP, she won't be paying for genetic drugs? That's a really good standard. It is a really good plan. All right, how is it on dental? Does it cover, like, dental visits and stuff as well? No, that doesn't. Dental is a separate plan. Now. I can. I can give you a call for dental. I would have. I would have to talk to one of my colleagues that does the dental part, which is with Cigna. We have dental with Cigna, you do have to pay a monthly, a month. They do charge monthly, but it's really good because it's dental, vision and hearing. So for all those three, I believe. Don't take my word for it, but I believe it's around $35 monthly. And you get to, you know, do your. You get to do dental. You get to do vision hearing if you need it. So it's a. It's really good. And it's Cigna, you know, so it's not. It's not about. Yeah. Yeah. Well, if you want, I can also give you a call when. If you want to talk to one of my colleagues, and he'll help you. He'll be more than happy to help you with that. Okay. So, yeah, I'm gonna give you the number. Yeah, no, definitely. I'm gonna give you the number. You can give us a call. You can ask my name is Karen with an I k a r I n. Okay, yes. Hold on. Let me get a piece of paper. Okay. Karen, you said? Yes, it's Karin. The phone number is 5613. What? Three. I'm sorry, I'll repeat that again. Five. 6133-636-3363 no, three. Six. Three. Okay, then it's 653-6365 6519. I'll repeat it all over again just in case. It's okay. So I'm going to tell you the full phone number. It's 561-363-6519 I got it. Awesome. So if you have any questions, any doubt, and you say, hey, Karen, I need to change this, or, I don't like this, or, I have a question about this, please, I'll be more than happy to help you, and we can work things out from there. I am going to ask you to please not give your information to any other agent. They are ads out there that say, oh, we're going to give you a gift card for $1,000, which I have seen, and I have clients that have told me that, and they say, your subsidy is going to be 2000. And unfortunately, that doesn't work like that. We work under the same umbrella, and they're not going to give you anything better than what I just got for you. The subsidies actually added to your healthcare plan. And people think that it's a gift card that they're getting, or food card, and that is false information, unfortunately. So what happens is that then they signed up, they put their information, and then every other agent will have your Social Security, your date of birth, your name. And it sucks because I know there's no going on. And I have my clients, they told me that we were gonna get free gift cards. And then, unfortunately, you just put your whole information in the marketplace, and that's not what I want, because it does suck, especially now that a bunch of frauds are going on. So just in the safe side, yes. I just recommend, if you do want any changes, just give me a call. Don't let other agents or any ads, you know, unfortunately, you know, just lie to you, right? You believe it. You signed up, and then your information is literally thrown in there and everybody could see it. I don't want that to happen. So I'm just letting you know ahead. I appreciate that. No, thank you. It sucks. Trust me, I have clients and I know. Yeah, that's. That's not. That's not a good thing. So I tell my clients, hey, listen, no, you can't give anything out. They're not. They're not going to get you anything better. We could work things out, but they're not. All right, perfect. So, Iris, thank you very much. You now have your healthcare plan. I will email you that as soon as we hang up. I'm going to send you in the email. You're going to see your summary benefits and your eligibility, and you're going to see your plan, which is the same thing you're going to see in your card once you get it. Okay? All right. Thank you very much. All right, Iris, it was a pleasure. Thank you very much. And whatever you need, we're here to help you out. Okay? Thank you. You have a blessed day. You, too. Thank you very much. Likewise. Thank you. Bye.
