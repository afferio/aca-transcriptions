    I tried to connect you. Hello, good afternoon. Thank you for calling the enrollment center here at borrowing insurance agency with the marketplace. This is Orlando speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? Tyrone Jones. I just had a call with you guys. Yes, I think you were speaking with me, Tyrone. My name is Orlando. Yes, sir. I'm not aware of that insurance. I'm most definitely not aware of that. And I didn't do that. And I'm basically looking forward to having shares with you guys. Like, I'm not aware of that, what you was talking about. All right, what I'll do, Tyrone, I'll tell you how to fix it. But I do need to have your word that you're willing to go through this call. Because anything after three minutes, my friends, our agency gets charged for that cost. If you don't have time right now or you hang up, we're gonna have to pay for something that we won't earn a commission on. I'll help you out. You've been enrolled in Unitedhealthcare since January 1 with Paula Fritz. What probably happened there, that's not even your agent. So this is what I. This is what I can do for you, my friend. We'll have to do a three way call with the marketplace. What you're going to do is you're going to tell them, hey, I'm speaking to Orlando here. I want him to be my agent moving forward. I want to give him permission for 365 days, and I want him to have control of my health plan. And then what we'll do is we'll open a fraud case so they don't charge you, you know, the tax credit on your tax return for this plan. If you're willing to do that, it's going to take about 25 minutes to do. The good thing is I'll be your agent. You'll know what health plan you have. We won't have to make that call anymore for 2024, and you won't have to do it for 2025. It's a one time thing. It's up to you if you want to move forward and do that. Okay? And this is, it will be free for all these other stuff, right? Correct. Yeah, we'll do it. Yeah, correct. What we have to do is we have to take, take care of that first. Once we take care of that, you and me will stay on the phone together, and then we'll pick a health plan. And then moving forward, I'll be your agent. So at least you know who your agent is. All right, you want to go ahead and do that. Yes, sir. So what I need to say now, so they're going to ask you, you know, do you give me. My name is Orlando Rodriguez. Do you give me consent to be your agent? They're going to ask you if it's going to be for one call or 365 days. Tell them 365 days. That means I'll be able to call the marketplace without you being on the line and make changes to your application. And that's what we want to do as an agent, just to have control of that health plan. And then you and I, after we're done with them, we'll stay on the line together and we'll pick a health plan together. All right? So you want to go ahead and move forward and do that three way call? Yes. All right, perfect. Bear with me. 1 second. Calling the health insurance marketplace direct line. Please enter your id number. All right, bear with me here. This call is being happy to call the marketplace call center while making updates to a consumer's coverage. One of them. This call may be monitored or recorded for quality and training purposes. Your feedback is important to us. Please remain on the line after you speak with a representative to complete a brief automated survey. All of our representatives are currently assisting other callers. Please stay on the line and our next available representative will assist you. Your estimated wait time is less than 1 minute. Thank you for contacting the marketplace. My name is Carly Wilson. How can I help today? Hey, Carly, how you doing? My name is Orlando Rodriguez. I'm a licensed agent. I received a phone call here to my agency from a gentleman by the name of Tyrone. I have him here on the line. He was looking for health insurance. Long story short, I searched him in the marketplace. I got his consent and permission to do so. And upon searching him, I saw that he had a united healthcare plan with an agent of Paola Fritz. He doesn't know who the agent is and he doesn't even know that he had a health plan. So we got disconnected. He called me back and he told me, hey, Orlando, look, I don't even know who Paola is. I don't know about this plan. So I explained to him we would have to do the three way with the marketplace and that he would have to give us permission for either one call or 365 days to represent him. I asked him for the one year approval and I have him here on the line and. And then we would like to take over that application, which I have the application id, and then offline him and I will get together and just move forward to see what's the best health plan for him. Okay, I'll be more than happy to assist. And you say you have your client on the line, correct? Yes, ma'am. Just follow her lead, she'll ask you a few questions and then I'll be here on the sideline. All right? Okay, may I have your first and last name, sir? Tyrone Jones. And what's your date of birth? 112 seven eight. Okay, one moment. Okay, and what's your address? I'm at six zip code. It's 6140 Karen David drive. The zip code is 35806. Okay, okay, one moment. Okay, and Mister Jones, you would like to authorize the agent on the line for the next calendar year? Yes, ma'am. Is that a good thing? May I have their name? Oh, no, it's not mean. It's not, it's not a bad thing. What that means is they'll be able to call the marketplace, make any changes to your record without you being on the phone. So it's not a bad thing. Okay, so may I have their name? Are you still online, sir? Yes, I am. She needs you to state the information. My name is Orlando Rodriguez. Tyrone. And then I can also give you my contact phone number to my agency as well. But she would need you to verbally state that for her. Orlando, I got to remember that. Orlando Rodriguez. Yes, ma'am. Okay, and Tyrone, what? She's basically okay, so we're going to authorize. Mister Orlando, I do apologize. Go ahead. No, I want to explain to him so he knows what he's doing. Tyrone. So what basically she's asking you is either you give us a consent for one phone call, one day, one week, one month or one year, 365 calendar days. What that means is we can call the marketplace, this phone number and not have to have you on the line and we would have permission to make changes without you being present. That's what we want as licensed agents, as an agency, because if not, every single time we would have to go through this process, we would have to have you, on the benefit of you having a licensed agent is that we can always, you know, call, you can always call us, tell us what changes and we can do it for you quickly without you having to endure this long phone call. Well, yeah, I'll do the three, I'll do the 365. Okay, no problem. Okay. All right, so I'm going to go ahead and add the verbal authorization to your account for 365 calendar days. So today, if you don't want to remain on the phone, Mister Jones, you can, you know, disconnect. And me and your agent, we can go ahead and handle everything for you and I'm quite sure that he'll call you back and let you know, you know, what everything looks like and give you all the details. But if you do want to stay on the line, Mister Jones, you can do that. It's totally up to you. Will you give me a call back, sir? Yes, I will. I have you as a contact phone number of 720-810-5103 and what I'll do is I'll go through the steps because we have to do something called reporting a life change. So it's going to take her about ten minutes. As soon as I'm done, I'll give you a call back, Tyrone, and that way you and I can get together and, you know, sort out your health needs. I know you have needs and things like that. I do want to ask you a question here with the marketplace agent. If you do have to go, Tyrone, before we disconnect. I know you told me you don't recognize that agent Paola Fritz. You don't know that you actually had Unitedhealthcare. I don't want to report this as fraud. I don't want to report this as fraud because I'm also a licensed agency and we obtained clients in different ways. Now did you sometime 2023 put your information into some type of ad? Maybe on Facebook, social media, YouTube, in your local supermarket, or anywhere where you probably remember giving consent to an agent so they can sign you up for health insurance? Because if you did, it wouldn't be fraud. You probably just don't remember. And that's when what happened. But do you recall a scenario in that manner? Facebook or something? But I never treat any cars or anything. No, like daddy used anything. And there's like that as you see it never been used or nothing like that. So that's what. Okay, so, so the carrier and I can go that over with the agent here. We're gonna, I'm gonna sign you forward with paper notices in the mail. You should receive two documents. It's called the plan details and the eligibility form straight from the carrier. So you will get mail from them. The id cards usually take about two weeks. I'm going to give you the carrier phone number offline. But you know, I'm not in the business of reporting other agents as fraud because if you do sign, you know, a consent form, which is a small power of attorney, you know, another agent from another agency is going to grab that and then that's a legal document. For them to actually go ahead and enroll you and then what I'll do is I'll sign you forward for paper notices and then I'm going to of course call you and then you're going to receive an email from me. But I just want to make sure as I proceed with the marketplace agent here, I want to know was this fraud or did you actually remember putting your information somewhere and maybe giving permission and consent for an agent signing you up into healthcare? I'm getting information. Okay, so Mister Jones, you're saying you did give someone permission to sign you up or would you? No ma'am. I'm thinking that it had to be some kind of pride, man, but I didn't. I don't recall joining all that, ma'am, because I never retrieved any cars. I know nothing like that. That's all the same. I'd have been utilizing and I wouldn't be going through this step today, you get what I'm saying? So. Right, right. And did you ever receive an email? Because usually what I do, Mister Jones, is I go Tyrone, I send emails out to my clients, no details about it, no emails. I know. Okay, no problem, you can proceed as you like. I just want to verify, because I've been accused from people calling the marketplace. I, myself and my agency have been accused of fraud. And it wasn't fraud, it's people who actually input their information into our data system and we have a consent and that's how we defend ourselves. So I don't want that to happen to another agent. If you did so, but if you didn't and you feel like it was fraud, just let the agent know on the phone here and then you can go ahead and drop off. I'll go over all the questions with her and then I will call you back. That way we can finalize the health plan for you. All right, give me a call back. Yes sir. All right. All right ma'am. All right, Mister Jones, you have a great day. Okay. Mister Rodriguez, are you still on the line? Yes, I am. Okay, so the policy from this year is actually a re enrollment from three. So that's how he got into the 24 plan. It was a rollover from last year, 2023. Okay, yeah, I'm sure it's not, I'm sure it's not fraud. You know, I'm not in the business of doing that. I mean obviously if she, if that agent enrolled him, you know, and like I said, we've been accused of that and it's a very frustrating thing because we don't have access to people Social Security number. I can't, I can most definitely identify with that because, you know, being a part of the marketplace here, we've been accused of changing people's plans and things like that, but we don't care about the nature of business that we're in. Correct. Yeah. And, and I'm sure that Agent Paola Fritz, I've seen her around, I've emailed her in the past a few times. I'm not going to contact her about a client, but obviously if she enrolled them, she has his Social Security number because you can't do an enrollment on our side through our platforms without the social. So obviously she got his social somehow, some way. But, you know, it was just concerning because what's concerning to me is a lot of these clients, they don't receive correspondence from the carriers, which they should, which is one of the reasons I always choose paper notices because they're supposed to get their eligibility and their plan details. It's two documents in the mail, and then, you know, a week later the id cards come, which take about two, two and a half weeks. But those two documents, what I do is I send them, I send it to them via email. So now they've been communicated, you know, from the carrier, you know, through the mailbox and then from myself via email. So I'm not going to report any fraud on that because once again, I'm sure that she had to have this social in order to enroll him. And that's not a piece of information you can attain unless somebody puts it into somewhere and signs a consent form. So I'll just do the life change event and we can just move forward there. I don't know if you need me to push the enrollment through on my side. Okay, so you did state that we needed to report a life change on his application, correct? Yeah, because we would be taking over the MTn on that application and the agent of record, and then that way it'll give us access to, to go through the application. All right. One moment. Sure. Okay, so let's pull up this application. So I have an application ending in 8839. Let me go back in there because since you were going to go in, I got out of the system. I'm sorry. Okay, so Tyrone Jones, marketplace application id 570-85-8839 correct. Okay, so we'll just go through the application, report a life change, anything that we need to update. We'll do that along the way. It shouldn't take very long. I'm pretty sure used to the process and I do apologize. I have to hiccup. Okay. It's okay. We'll probably keep it. I'll verify everything for you. We'll keep everything the same and then offline. I'll get with him and review it just to speed up the process. No problem. Thank you for your help. Alright, so I do have to make you aware of our privacy policy here at the marketplace and how we use the information. Basically, it states that the information provided will be used to see if they're eligible for coverage and if they can get help with the cost of that coverage. We'll compare their information with other federal government agencies and consumer reporting agency. If the information doesn't match, they may have to send back documents to prove information. So you agree that we can use data from these agencies for you or for your client and anyone listening to the application? Yes, ma'am. Okay. And you understand that you need to give honest answers to all questions. You may have to provide additional proof of your answers. If you don't, you may face penalties like losing your coverage. Correct. All right, so we're going to go ahead and get started here. So we're leaving the name, date of birth. Six. All that the same address. 6140 Karen David Price, northwest Huntsville, Alabama. Correct? Yep. One 1219 78 is the birthday. Tjone 19. Seven eight. Threemail.com phone number. Seven 20 810 5103. Okay. All that matches. All right. Preferred language is English. We're going to do paper notices in the mail. Correct. The agent listed is Raul Guzman. I guess we're going to put. I'll put myself as the authorized person to call, but the NPN is going to go under the agency principal owner here that we have. Her name is Karen. K a r I as in India, ndez. Okay. Is there a last name? Yes, ma'am. And the last name is. And I'll spell it out for you letter by letter. It's s as in Sam, a as in alpha, g as in golf, a as in alpha, s as in sam, t as in tango, e as in echo. Then there's a dash followed by g as in golf, u as in uniform, I as in India. And then it's the word espejo altogether. That's e as in elephant, s as in Sam, p as in papa, e as in echo, j as in Juliet. And the last letter is o as in Oscar. So it's sagastogy with the hyphen and then Especo altogether. Okay. And the MPN 20979 642-097-9642 Correct. Yep. Let me double check. It is 2097-9642 correct. Okay. And Tyrone is single, filing a single tax return. No tax dependent, not married. I. No children under age 18. Not American Indian, Alaska native. Are currently incarcerated. Correct. I see we skipped the questions about race and gender. Optional. Okay. Last four of social. I see a 0696 confirmed. Okay. Us citizen, no disability, no Medicaid. Correct. Okay. Household income. We have an annual total of 18,200. Is that staying the same? Correct. It's staying the same, yeah. Okay. And I'll verify that with him offline as well. Okay. He's currently enrolled in a health plan through the marketplace. One moment. Is he being offered an HRA, an HSA, or any employer coverage? Negative. Okay. All right. One moment. Okay. Then we have a loss of qualifying coverage, a date entered 731 2023. And I know that needs to be changed because that's not going to work, correct? Yeah. We can put seven. It has time frame of 630 and 829. Let's put 7120, 24. And has he had any other changes like gaining a dependent moving or being released from incarceration? No. All right, so that was quick. I have to go over these statements and then we'll start and submit the application to get the new eligibility results. Let's do it. All right. First statement. To make it easier to determine eligibility for help paying for health coverage in future years, do you agree to allow the marketplace to use income data, including information from tax returns, for the next five years? The marketplace will send a notice that you make any changes. You can opt out at any time. Agree or disagree? Agree. Okay, next statement. If anyone on the application is enrolled in marketplace coverage, and it's also found to have Medicare coverage, the marketplace will end the coverage. So do you agree to allow the marketplace to end the coverage if they're enrolled in both marketplace and Medicare? Correct. Okay. If not, you'll be responsible for the whole premium tax credit for the full price? Yes. So, no, you must tell the program that you'll be enrolled in. If any information you list on the application changes, know that a change in information can affect eligibility for members of the household. Agree? Agree. Okay, last statement. You're signing this application under penalty of perjury, which means you provided honest answers to all questions. To the best of your knowledge, know that you may be subject to penalties under federal law if you intentionally provide false information. Agreed? Agreed. And you have my permission and my consent to do the digital signature on his behalf. All right. And we're going to submit it. Give me just one moment. Sure. And your name is again? I'm sorry? Oh, my name is Carly. Carly. Carly. You need to give me your phone number and extension so I can do these with you because you're very fast. I wish I could, but we don't have an extension. Like it's at random. You never know who you're going to get when you call the marketplace. Like Forrest Gump says, it's like a box of chocolates. Oh, yeah. And I get the box of chocolates that I don't like most. Oh, my God, you have no idea. The agent. Agent. The other day, 47 minutes on the phone. I'm like, jesus Christ, please. Yeah, it doesn't take that long. It does. So we're done updating the application. He has a special enrollment period until tomorrow. That'll be the last day for him to change the plan or pick a new plan. The tax credit is 743, and he also has the cost share reductions for silver plans. Now is there a plan that you want to go ahead and put him in, or do you want to discuss that with him first? No, go ahead and push it for me. Because if you don't push it, just. I know we use different systems, but just enroll him in that united plan, because if you don't, then when we go back into the application, it gives us that red error message. So just put him in that healthcare, and then I'll get with him and we'll decide. Okay, give me one moment. So he's using all the tax credit. Is there any tobacco use? No tobacco use, and we'll use the full subsidy there. Okay, one moment. I'm logged out. Let me know when to log back in and then I'll push it through on my side. Okay. All right, so the current plan is the UHC bronze value with a $8,300 deductible out of pocket. Max, 94 50, no charge to see the doctor. That's the one he wants to go with? Yeah, yeah, that's the plan. We're going to keep him on, and then I'll get with him offline on the recorded line, and we'll review the health plans. Because he didn't even know he had that health plan. So there may be something better out there than that bronze plan. I know you're the licensed agent. So you'll go over that with him. Correct. Just to throw that out there? Maybe something better. I appreciate that. Yeah, that's why you'll hear us tell you just to push it through, because we can't see it until you push it through. So once you just enroll him in that plan, then we have the ability to access on our side the application. Then we can see the list of plans, you know, with Aetna united. Yeah, yeah. It won't let us. It won't let us see it. Okay, so he's using the whole tax credit, which means he must reconcile by filing a tax return. If the income is different, you know, they may be at risk of paying something back or they may be more of a premium tax credit. So I'm going to go ahead and push that through and. Okay, it's pushed through now it has a nine month start date for the UHC bronze value. So if you can confirm on your end, I don't know how long it takes to, you know, change or show you, but maybe you can check that out and see if that's correct. Yep, it should be 1 second. What you want to do is tell your agents to refresh their system after they refresh it, log out, close the browser, reopen the browser, log back in, and then edit the application from the last point. And they know what that means when you say the last point. And it should be able to adjust the NPM. So let me double check. Sometimes it does it, sometimes the system doesn't. It will take a little bit of time. See, and what's weird is that on our end, right, the last qualifying event, date of seven, one that we chose, when you guys update it for us, it doesn't appear. Oh, yeah, it appears blank. And I've mentioned that to several agents that the synchronization is supposed to be live, right? It's supposed to be, supposed to synchronize live, but every single time. For example, that date of 7120 24 that we chose, it would appear blank. So I just input it. Now I'm synchronizing. It should connect to yours and then let me go ahead and adjust the MPN here. And it should. And it did. Excellent. Confirmed. Okay, so we got everything pushed through. It'll take about a couple of weeks, you know, for everything to be sent out. If it takes over those, that two week timeframe, you may have to reach out to United healthcare and see what, what the delay is. On his own, on his information for his plan. Correct. No problem. Sounds great. Everything's good on my end. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. All right. You're very welcome. And thank you so much for reaching out to the marketplace. You have a great day. You too. Have a blessed day. Bye bye. Thank you. Bye bye. Welcome to the marketplace. Customer experience survey. Your feedback will help improve the service you receive in the future.
