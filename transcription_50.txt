All right, so, Sylvia, just a few questions here, just to see if you pre qualify. Do you currently. Are you aware of you currently have a health plan with Medicaid, Medicare, the VA, tricare, or any other job based health plan? No, I received Medicare. Medicare. But I'm looking for something better. Like in the marketplace. Yeah, if you have a Medicare plan right now, they would. Then even though I pushed the application for you, they're going to deny it. Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry. I wouldn't be able to help you out for that reason. That's why we always ask at the beginning. I don't want to get to that portion of the call and then waste your time. But if you have Medicaid, Medicare, job base, or you have the VA or tricare, I can push it for you. It'll get approved, and then after 48 hours, it'll just fall off. Okay. All right. I'm sorry about that, Sylvia. Well, you have my phone number. If anything changes or you need anything, you can always give us a call back. And my name is Orlando, and I'll be here to help you out. All right, thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Bye.
