All right, let me see if that is one of my. Okay, so it's a student. Student status, correct? Yes. Yeah. Okay. And what is your I 94 number? Do you have that with you? No. Do you have a passport number with a country of issuance? Yes. Okay, I'll go ahead and take the passport number when you're ready. I'm sorry. Is it mandatory for the application passport number? It is, sir, because if I put that you're a citizen, what's going to happen is they're going to ask you to verify your citizenship, and if you don't do so in 30 to 45 days, they're going to cancel your health plan. So they asked me, what type of legal status do you have? I put the f one. So with the f one, what they asked for is the I 94 number, which is that little visa card that, you know, your entry card along with the passport and the country that you're coming from and the expiration date. I'm only asking you what the government system asks for. I got it, but I'm sorry, I can't share my passport number. Okay, I understand. What I could do is I can continue the application for you, but do you have any other type of document that you can, that you can provide? No, I already shared my SSN number. Right. So you can verify with that. Okay, go ahead. It's 731721. No, no, 731. Let me see if that accepts it. 1 second. And what number is this? I'm sorry? I said 731-79-0625 okay, and that is your service id number? It's Social Security number, SSN number. Okay, 1 second. Let me see if it accepted. Okay, so in order for you to apply for the marketplace plan, you do have to be a citizen. If you're not a citizen, it's going to ask me for one of these documents if I put an f one visa. In order to move forward, you have to provide the I 94 number, the passport number, the country of issuance, and the expiration date if you want to move forward in the application. If not, I'm sorry, sir, but I wouldn't be able to help you because the system is asking me for it. I can understand, but I can't share it right now. So no problem. All right. Well, you can always give us a call back whenever you're interested in getting health insurance. We would need that information from you. And once again, that goes into a database system where your information is secure. It's with the marketplace, CMS, and it's an affordable care act health plan. Our goal is always to try to get to that health plan for free, but it does require for you to identify your identity since the government is paying for it and without citizen citizenship status, they do require a certain document. But whenever you feel comfortable providing that, you can always give us a call back. Yep, sure. Thank you. Thank you. No problem. Take care.
