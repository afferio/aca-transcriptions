    Try to connect you. Thank you for calling the enrollment center for Health insurance at the marketplace. This is Orlando speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? My name is Melissa Carter Davis. Hi, Melissa. How you doing? And are you looking for health insurance today through the marketplace? I did not know it was the marketplace. They've tried to sign me up for that, and I don't. I don't qualify right now. Well, I can ask you some pre qualifying questions. And that is, do you have Medicare? Medicare, yes. The person that I spoke to was confident that I would be approved. Okay. Okay. And what is your estimated annual income? Well, what I'm hoping for is between 15 and 16,000. I'm not sure, but hopefully that is the range between 15 and 21, depending what state you're calling me from. Oh, Texas. Texas. So Texas is a minimum of 16,000, and that's fine. They usually fluctuate a little bit higher, a little bit down. What I can do is I can help you run a quote for you, and then we can see what different health options, such as a blue cross blue shield, United Cigna, we can qualify you for. And based on the qualification questions that I just asked you, 99.9%. You can probably qualify for a free health plan. Okay, good. I need those odds. No problem. Let me go ahead and start recording this call, because I do have to have this call recorded for quality purposes. 1 second. No word. Okay. This call is being recorded. Okay. And may I have your first name and last name again, please? It's legally, it's Melissa. Melissa. The last name is Carver. C A R v E R. Davis. Perfect. Davis. And your date of birth certificate? In my hand, it still has to be Davis. No problem. Don't like it. I'm sorry. And what is your date of birth? June 27, 1970. 1970. Perfect. And you're calling me from Texas. And while I do search you in the marketplace just to see if you have an existing health plan already, which I see you don't, which is great. So that means we can get an application started. Just for the record, I do have to state my name is Orlando Rodriguez. My license number is 20 four. Thank you. And my license number is 2079-7253 and just for the record, today is August 26, 2024. For 11:00 p.m. they make us go through all of that just in case. If there is any issues, you know, the center for Medicaid and Medicare, they get involved for purposes of recording. So I would be your licensed agent moving forward. Melissa, if we do find your health plan. Did you give me your permission and consent to represent you on your health plan? I do, yes. Orlando Rodriguez. And let me give you my phone number now that we're at it here from the beginning. That way, in case we get disconnected, if you see a call back from a certain number, you know that it's the phone number from my agency. Yes. Okay. So my phone number is five six. 1363-651-9519 got it? Yep. So any questions in the future or any concerns or any frustrations that you may be going through, Melissa, you can always feel free to contact me at that phone number. And once we pick a health plan for you here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to send you an email with all the contact information of myself, the agency, and then I'm also going to send it to you via text message. That way you have it all recorded on your phone. Yes. I love that. Thank you. Okay. Absolutely. So I'll go ahead and get an application started for you. It takes me literally seven minutes, and I'm out of your way for the rest of 2024 and 2025. Because some people ask me, how long is this going to take? I said, listen, I go through them quick, just follow what I ask and we'll be out of your way. And I tell them, and I won't bother you for the rest of 2024 or 2025. So that's a great thing. What we're going to do is correct. Correct. Yeah. I'm not from the marketplace. I am an insurance agency. We're third party. We work with them because they just have so much call volume. They can't handle it, so they outsource it to us. And we just help individuals like yourself, whether they have a life changing event. They got pregnant, they adopted a child, foster care, they may have gotten released from incarceration. Maybe they moved or they're just low income individuals and they just are going through a financial hardship. We do our best to help get qualified. I was. I just got out of incarceration, picked up for charges I didn't know I had from five years ago, and they extradited me to California. It was very scary. Oh, my goodness. That's horrible. Horrible. Wow. I borrowed a t shirt and they had. Oh, my God. Felony burglary. That's not a t shirt. And gave it back. Oh, no, that's horrible. Went there and then obstructing an officer. But they lowered the. They lowered the charges. Oh. And leaving the fleeing mistake. But they took that away. They lowered the charges to this misdemeanors, and I can get them expunged in six months. So I could have stayed in jail for another year and a half and fought it down to nothing. But I didn't want to stay in jail any longer, I said, and were you involved in that? Where is that? Somebody that compromised your identity and that happened? Oh, I was involved in that. You were involved? Well, I know I'm all the way in Miami, Florida. I know you're in Texas. I've been to Texas. I was in the military. I was up in corpus crispy. But I know that California is a. Yep, I know California is an own animal of its own, so I don't even want to know the details. I was incarcerated with people that were in jail for attempted murder, grand theft auto, drug trafficking, prostitution, constitution. I mean, you name it, I hear you. They were, and they were guilty, and they admitted they were guilty. Like, I don't belong here. Yeah, I hear you. It's a bad experience. I'm sorry you went through that. Well, in the good light of things, hopefully that gets resolved for you. Let me go ahead and process, and, hey, you know, and then you. We can go ahead and process this application for you, and we can get you squared away here with coverage, and I think that would put you in a better spot. So I'll start this application process for you here, Melissa, and then you just correct me if I have any piece of information wrong. So I am going to have to collect all your personal information, and then we put it into the marketplace, which is a safe website. Nothing that they can compromise your identity or anything like that. And then we'll take it from there. So I have the first name as Melissa. The last name is Carver, c a r v e r hyphen Davis. And I have a birth date of 220 719 70 from the state of Texas. And I do have to ask this question. I know it's a not just question, but legally, I have to ask it. Do you identify in your. In your birth as a female or male? As far as gender, I have to ask. I'm sorry. I am a female all the way through. Thank you. And, Melissa, I. That's who I am. I hear you. And then when you are ready, I will need two more pieces of information. That would be your Social Security number and your home address. Okay, so my social. Are you ready for that? Yes, ma'am. Okay. It's 538-66-9691 Perfect. Let me enter the system. 538-66-9691 Perfect. And then your home address. 5922 Hidden Peak Street. H I d d e n. Like it's hiding. Hidden Peak street. And that's San Antonio. Okay. And then peak is. And peak is p e a k. That's correct. Okay. And the zip code? 782477. Perfect. Yep. Hidden Peak Street, San Antonio, Texas. Got it. And then, Melissa, I do need a valid email address so I can send you everything you know as far as your plan details and the eligibility form that we take for you. My email is mJcd. My initials mjcdtexasmail.com. okay, perfect. So I'll verify that for you. M as in Mike, J as in Juliet, C as in Charlie, D as in delta. The word texasmail.com. that's it. And then I have a 210-461-0527 as a valid contact phone number. That's right. I. Okay, and then you will be receiving paper notices in the mail from the carrier. And then you're going to get them via email as soon as we hang up. I'll send you that email within ten minutes of us speaking here. Thank you. Okay, very good. Now, I did search in the marketplace, and nothing popped up with that information until I put your social. And I think you may have health coverage already. But I wouldn't be able. I did for a moment, but. But I just enrolled myself month. Okay. And we may have to. We may have no projected income at that time. I see. And we may have to call the marketplace together just really quick. I'm just to update that. And I can handle that for you. But let me see if I can get to it. It might reject me because since you already had probably another agent who did it for you, it'll just send me an error message. I'll put you on a three way really quick. Tell them, hey, I want to give Orlando the authority to represent me on there. I can represent you on there, and then we'll be through. And then what I can do for you is I don't want you to go through that grieving phone call that we do with them. So what I'll do is I'll do the phone call and then I'll call you back. And then I'll say, hey, Melissa, I have these carriers available for you in your zip code. And you tell me, hey, Orlando, I don't like this one. I want this one. No problem. Or you can let me know if you have a carrier in mind, like Blue Cross ambed or United Signa. You know, Oscar, not sure if you have a carrier in mind? I don't. Just whatever one. I think Blue Cross is the best one. Maybe. I don't know. Okay. I'll definitely find you. I'm going to find you something for free, for sure, with the six main carriers. Definitely. Just, I wanted to be free for you. So I do see a blue cross plan here, and I like this one. It's a zero dollar premium. I have two $0 premiums for Blue Cross. I have a zero dollar, 30 dollar premiums for United one with Aetna, but this one seems to be the best. No charge on the doctor visits. So it's a blue cross. My blue silver CSR plan, $0 a month dollar, zero deductible. It's a dollar 786 tax credit that they're giving you for that. And the doctor visits, basically free is what I see here in my end. And your generic drugs are only $5 if you needed some type of generic drug, which is a very good plan. So let me see it. Actually, let me enroll you in that without having to call the marketplace. So I am going to go back into the plans just to review them one more time. So I do have you here on a blue cross, Texas, with a dollar zero premium, zero dollar deductible, no charge on the doctor visits, and dollar five generic drugs, 786 credit. That's from Blue Cross. Now, I also have a United healthcare plan, also $0. It'll cost you $0 on the deductible. The doctor visits are also free at no charge. The specialist is $60. And your generic drugs. If you ask me my opinion, I would go with the United healthcare plan. And this is why I was thinking Orlando. The same thing. Yeah. And the reason. And the reason why, Melissa, is because in your United healthcare plan, if you decide to visit a specialist, let's say an ob gyn or a cardiologist or an endocrine, I do need a specialist right now for my ankle. Yeah. Your. Your specialist visits with United are $60. What happens with Blue Cross is it's 30% of the visit. And the problem is, if they charge you, let's say, a $1,000, you have to pay 30%. 30%. So in my opinion, I think we should go with the United healthcare plan. I think so, too. Yes, I agree. Perfect. All right. So, because this is a recorded call, Melissa, I do have to state we'll be enrolling you in the United health care plan. That is a gold plan HMO, which is an awesome plan. Usually, individuals don't get the gold, they get the silver plan, $0 a month as far as coverage, no charge on the doctor visit. Zero dollar deductible. Once again, there is a small fee on the generic drugs of $5. And then your specialist visits are $60. That plan is going to be effective on 9120 24. The tax subsidy credit is $741. Yep. Tax credit. Tell me that one more time. $741.19 is, is what the government has approved as a tax credit in order to get you this health care plan for free. Now, your income, I have it here based on $15,000. So I'm going to leave it there because it looks like this existing application that you had in the past. I guess when you canceled it in the past, it did have that salary. So I'll leave it there. If it does give me a little bit of problems with the salary, I'll just let you know. I'll be raising it to 16,000, which shouldn't make a difference for you because the state limit in Texas, right? 16,000. Yes. Yep. It's the minimum of 16. Okay, perfect. And then what you would be getting would be your id cards. In about two weeks from United Healthcare, I'll be sending you an email with the plan details, the eligibility form. You're going to get those as well in the mail along with the id cards. And then in the email, I'll send you a screenshot that shows the United Healthcare plan, zero dollar plan. You'll have my name, the name of the agency, how you can contact me with phone number. You'll have the email. I'll be sending you a text message here from my personal work cell phone number because I'll be your licensed agent moving forward. And effective 91st September 1, you have coverage on the health side. So that's good news for you. All right. I hope everything works out for you, Melissa. You know, and if you ever do have any questions, feel free to call me. If you have any friends or family members that we can help out and be a blessing to that they might be going through a financial hardship, they're low income, maybe they moved or they have any issues, please let me know because we're definitely here to be a blessing and help. All right. I will do exactly that. All right. And then the last piece of information I always ask for my clients is just remember me as Orlando. We will be your. My agency will be your health, you know, insurance agent moving forward. If you do get any other calls from individuals who are saying, hey, Melissa, I can help you with free money. I can send you a check in the mail. Are you going through hard financial hardship? We'll send you money toward your light bill, your water bill, money toward your utilities. Melissa, those are all lies. We all work with the marketplace, and the marketplace doesn't that they do that to you just because they're interested in gaining your application. Because we make a commission off of it. Right. So they'll lie to you and promise you things that are false in order to try to get you to sign with them. Just tell them, hey, I'm not. Because you don't want. You don't want to give your social and your information out to everyone. So tell them, I'm already working with an agent. His name is Orlando. He's out of Miami, Florida. I know his agency. I'm not interested. And please don't give out your information to anybody else. Okay. All right. And if you need anything from me, let me know. I'll be sending you a text message soon. And in the next five minutes, you'll see an email pop up there, maybe on your phone or on your browser with all my information and agency information. Cool. Okay. That was easy. All right. It is very easy. Thank you so much, Melissa. And if there's anything else you need, please always feel free to reach out. Email us, call us, send us a back a text. We're here to be a blessing. Will do. I appreciate that. All right. Thank you. Hope everything works out for you. Have a great week. Thank you. You, too. All right, bye.
