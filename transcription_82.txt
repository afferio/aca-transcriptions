Not with the VA, Medicare or Medicaid, correct? No. And you don't have health care or a health plan through your employer because you're self employed, is that correct? Yes. All right. All right. So I do have to read these attestants out to you. In order for me to successfully be able to enroll you in this health plan, you would need to agree in order to move forward with the health plan. However, it is your decision whether you want to agree or disagree? And I'll read these assessments for you at the end, please answer each one. To make it easier to determine your eligibility for helping to pay for coverage in future years, you agree to allow the marketplace to use your income data, including information from your tax returns, for the next five years. Do you agree or disagree? Yeah. All right. And I understand that I'm not eligible for a tax credit if I'm found eligible for qualifying health coverage like Medicaid, Medicare, with the VA, the children's chip, or a job based health plan. Do you understand and agree? Yeah.

If I'm married at the end of 2024, I must file an income tax together with my spouse. I also understand that no one else will be able to claim as a dependent on their 2024 tax return. Do you agree?

I know I may make these changes in my marketplace account by calling the marketplace at 1800 318 25 96. Or what you can do, Mister Villi, is at the end. I'll give you my phone number. You can always contact me, and you can report any changes like moving or, you know, anything that may affect your health plan. You can always report it to me. Do you agree? Yes. Okay. And we have two more. And we're done. I'm signing this application under penalty of perjury, which means I provided true answers to all of the questions. To the best of my knowledge, I know I may be subject to penalties under federal law if I intentionally provide false information. Do you agree? Yes. Okay. And do you give me your permission, Mister Vili Lasayette, to sign this application on your behalf and to be your agent of record for your health plan for 2024 and automatic enrollment into 2025. Do I have your permission? Yes. Excellent. All right, so let's. Let's see what we can populate here. Just bear with me as my system loads, and then we'll go over the health plans that are available to you in your area. So I have three health plans, mister Vili. I'll go over three carriers. There's a million plans, but I always want to pick the best option for you. The first one that I have is a gold plan with Unitedhealthcare. They applied a $1,130 tax subsidy to make that plan free, so you wouldn't have to pay anything. The deductible is zero. There's no charge in your doctor visits, and your specialist fees are only $60. $3 generic drug fee. So your generic drugs will only be $3. This is with United Healthcare. The next one I have would be the ambetter plan. Same tax subsidy, dollar, zero premium. However, this one has a dollar 750 deductible. And to go to the doctor's, $35. It's not free. That's why I don't recommend that one. And it's exactly the same plan with Aetna. So, as your agent, what I would recommend for you would be the United Healthcare plan. Zero dollar premium, $1,130 subsidy tax credit, zero dollar deductible. If you had a deductible, it'll be free. The doctor visits are free. Your generic drugs are only dollar three, and your specialist fee is only dollar 60. So if you ask me what health plan I would go with, it would definitely be that United healthcare plan. And it's a gold plan, which is pretty nice that they're offering you that. Is that something that you would be interested in moving forward with? Yes. Excellent. So we are enrolling you in the United healthcare plan. Gold plan, UHC standard, zero dollar individual with a dollar, zero deductible. No charge on the doctor visits, $3 generic drugs. And of course, that plan is free. That plan will start effective on nine one, meaning September 1. That plan will go active. You will be receiving once again, those plan details and that eligibility form in the mail and your id cards should be coming in about two weeks. I would like you to write down two phone numbers, mister Vili. The first one would be the phone number to the carrier, and the second one would be my phone number, since I'll be your agent moving forward for your health insurance plan. That way you can call me if you have any questions. Let me know when you're ready to write down these details. Okay. All right, so my name is Orlando Rodriguez. So you can put Orlando. And my phone number is 506 1363-6519 okay. All right, so I'll be your agent, Mister Villi. And if you do get any other phone calls from anybody else offering you money, a subsidy, offering you a check in the mail, or asking you if you know if they can be your agent, just neglect them. Tell them, hey, I'm not interested. I already have an agent. His name is Orlando. I'm working directly with him, and I work directly with the marketplace as a third party, I can answer any of your questions. So the reason I say that is because I don't want your Social Security number and your information being all out there. So please don't give your information to any other agent. All right? And then the next phone number would be for Unitedhealthcare. And when you're ready, I'll go ahead and give you that phone number. Okay, it's one eight 1844-390-4522 so that is United healthcare phone number. In case you don't receive your id cards. You can give me a call or you can call them directly and say, hey, I signed up for, you know, health coverage. You guys never, you know, you guys never sent me my id cards, but you should be getting those in the mail in about two weeks. All right then. All right, mister Billy. So you have my phone number again. Pleasure to get to know you. My name is Orlando. I am with mall insurance agency. I'll be your agent for this year and next year. And if you have any questions, always feel free to give me a call. All right. Congratulations on your health plan. You got it for free. Unitedheal healthcare. Yeah. All right. All right. Thank you. Have a great cigarette. Yes, there is.
