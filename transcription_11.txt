    Connect you. Thank you for calling the enrollment partner. This is Orlando speaking. Are you calling in concerning health insurance? Yes, the man hooked me to you. Okay, sounds great. And my name is Orlando Rodriguez. I do have to start recording this call for quality purposes. This call is being recorded. And again, my name is Orlando Rodriguez. My license number is 2079-7253 and ma'am, I represent a mola insurance agency. We work directly with the marketplace to help individuals, for whatever reason, may be to be able to find health insurance in that. And you are calling concerning a health plan today, correct? Yeah, they called me. Okay, and are you looking for health insurance? Yeah, he supposed to hook me up to one. I don't know. Okay. Okay. No, that's what I'm here for. And I can help you definitely go through that here. And can I have your first name and last name? Angela. Dolly. All right, Angela. And can you spell out your last name for me just to make sure I have it correctly? D o l l e y. D o l L e y. Perfect. And your date of birth? Angela. And the state that you're calling me from 1st 21st 1969, Mississippi. You're in Mississippi. All right, so you're down south? I'm in Miami, Florida, so I'm a little more southeast than you are. How's the weather going out over there? Hot. Okay. Yeah, I know what you're talking about. On the side. Down here in Miami, it's 85 degrees even on Christmas day. Oh, you like here? Yep. Angela. So upon you know, using your information that you provided me here to look you and search you up in the marketplace, I do see that you already have a health plan active as of February 1 with the company and health care name Ambeddr. Under the agent of record named Stephen Schultz. I'm not sure if you are aware of that or not. I didn't get the paper and all of this stuff, so I guess I will. I don't know. Yeah, I didn't get it. You didn't get it? Well, I mean, I can do something for you. And this is what I do. I always. First thing I do is I always ask you guys to get a piece of paper, write down my name, my phone number, and I give you my license number. That way, if you ever not happy with anything, you ever want to file a complaint, you always have my license number. I do things 100% legit and honest. I run into all these calls all the time where people come in and they say, I don't know how to health plan. And I always say, well, there might be a point of time that you probably filled out an ad, maybe online, and you probably gave consent or permission to somebody to go and use your information to enroll you in a health plan. But then they're like, yeah, I did that at some point, but, you know, I didn't even know I had a health plan. I don't even know who that agent is. So the next step, I tell them is, this is the only thing I can legally do for you because we all work with the marketplace, and that is I can put you on a three way call with the marketplace. I'll be representing you on that call. They're going to ask you to verify your identity, name, last name, address, phone number, email, date of birth, Social Security number, ask you to verify everything. Then they're going to ask you if you give me permission either for one call or 365 days to speak on your behalf without you being on the line. I always ask my clients to give me the power for. To do it for 365 days because it's about a 20 minutes call, and I don't want to have to, I don't want to have to bother you every time I call them just to make sure your plan is good and I oversee your health plan. What happens is, if you didn't even know you had health insurance, the government applies $848 tax subsidy. You're going to get charged that by your accountant next year. So if you didn't know, what I always do is I always cancel the plan first. Well, well, I can call them then and see what happened to my papers and stuff because I remember talking to somebody. Okay. But, uh, I can call them and find out and see if they send it on to me then? Okay. Would you like me to do that three way call and then give me the ability and the consent and the permission to take over your plan and represent you moving forward? Or do you want to handle it on your end? I can handle it on my own because I didn't know. I need to get my paperwork then, don't I? Okay. Okay. I mean, I can help you with all of that if you like. You know, it's definitely up to you. Yeah, but I'm at work now. Okay, well, let me give you my contact information anyhow. Yeah, please do that for me. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me get a picture, because I can tell you, I'm gonna tell you, you're not gonna know who to call to solve this problem. I know you don't because you don't have the phone number to the marketplace. This is why it's always great to have an agent, because we can represent you in that application, you know? And like I said, like I told my last client, one of my last clients, they called me from Missouri, right next to, you know, right next to you. And they told me, they said, orlando. I'm so happy I did this, because a 20 minutes phone call solves my life for the next year in 2025. I said, exactly. It's a one time call. We'll get you fixed up this year. It'll automatically enroll into 2025, and we don't need to bother you anymore. You know who I am? I know who you are. You have my contact info, and now you actually know what health insurance you have. So it's like that client told me this morning, like, thank you so much for. For taking the time. I said, no, thank you for understanding that a 20 minutes call actually helps you. So it's totally up to you. It's in your hands. Yeah. Okay. What's the number? My phone number is 561363. Okay. 6519. Okay. And my name is orlando. Like the city orlando in Florida. Orlando. My last name is Rodriguez. R o d r I g u e as in elephant and Z as in zebra. Orlando Rodriguez. Okay. My license number is 2079-7253 so you can give me a call. And once again, what I recommend, ma'am, is give me a call. Because what I want to do is I want to get that health plan for you canceled because they gave you a tax credit. What a tax credit is next year, when you do your taxes, they're going to remove that from your tax return, and you're getting something removed from your tax return that you didn't even know you had. That's why I'm urging you. And not only do I. I mean, I make my commission, I make my money off of this. But aside from that, to be able to help you so you know what health plan you have to be able to save you from that tax subsidy hitting you because you didn't even know the health plan and you didn't even know the agent. That's why I'm asking for your permission to take over the plan, and I'm going to clean all that up for you. So when you have about 2030 minutes, give me a call. And we have to do a three way with them. Okay, look, then you say your number was 2079-7253 no, no, it's five six one. No, sir, that's your phone number. 561-363-6519 yeah, 6519. Correct. My license number is 2079-7253 okay. I always give up my license number so people don't. They're not scared when they give me their information over the phone. I said, if you ever want to file a complaint against me with the government and the federal agency, there's my state license number. I represent all 48 states with the marketplace. I work with Cigna, Blue Cross, United Healthcare, Molina. I work with all the carriers. All right, well, I'm sure don't get back with you. Well, I'm here. I'm here today until 06:00. Sure. You in Monday? I'm in on Monday. I'm in every single day. I mean, you're on. I'm in Miami, I'm in eastern time. So I think we have the same time frame. But feel free to call me. Yep, I sure will. Because I need that because I didn't get my paperwork. Well, with me, we're going to clean everything up for you. You're going to get your paperwork, you're going to get your id cards in two weeks, from the moment you and I work together, then I'm going to send you all that paperwork through email. And then we're also going to get you reimbursed for that tax credit because you're going to take it out of your tax return. So, you know, I benefit from this, but in benefiting from this, I'm going to go ahead and help you out and get everything cleaned up for you. But we do need about 2030 minutes with them on the line. Okay? And thank you so much. No, absolutely, ma'am. I'm here to call away. Thank you. God bless you. And you're welcome. Thank you. And same to you. Have a good weekend. You, too. Bye. Thank you. Bye.
