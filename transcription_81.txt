    To connect you. Thank you for calling Mola insurance. My name is Orlando. Are you looking for health insurance today? Yes. Hello. How are you, ma'am? And may I have your first name and last name? My name is Annette Dickerson. You said Annie Dickerson? Correct. Annette Dickerson. All right. And, Annette, while I go ahead and bring up my system to see if you have a current health plan with the marketplace, do you have any other health plan, like with your employer or Medicaid, Medicare, or anything of that matter? No, not that I know of. No. All right. And we'll search the system here just to verify, because if you do, I wouldn't be able to help you. So let's get that search going. And may I have your date of birth? Okay. My birthday is 326 65. All right, and what state are you calling me from? Annette? I'm calling from St. Louis. From where? I'm sorry, what state? St. Louis, Missouri. Missouri. Okay, perfect. And Annette is spelled a n n e t e, correct? Yes. Perfect. All right, so we're searching here, Annette. All right, 1 second. My system froze here. Sorry about that. Let me try again. Annette, and you said Dickerson and your birthday again? Annette. I'm sorry. 1865. Perfect. And from Missouri. And let's see if something populates here. Yep. You do have a health plan enrolled already in the marketplace for 2024. So you do have health insurance. What? What. What is that? Yep. They have you here with blue cross blue shield. Under an agent? Yep. Under the name of an agent from Sangria. Hogan, the last four of your home. 0449. And your address? 189 Rock Drive. Do you recognize that agent? I didn't know I was. Huh? Do you recognize that agent? I didn't know I was under no blue cross blue shield. Yeah. The way I can fix this for you, if you like, we can do a three way with the marketplace, and I can have them put me as your agent, and then you and I can work together. Do you want to do that? Well, I wouldn't mind doing it, but I've been holding on this phone for the longest, and I'm really trying to get out here and go to Bible study. Okay. So you can.
