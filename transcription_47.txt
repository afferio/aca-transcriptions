    I tried to connect you. Good day. Thank you for calling the enrollment center. Enrollment center here with one insurance agency. Third party with the marketplace. My name is Orlando. Are you looking for health insurance today? Yeah. All right. And may I have your first name, sir? It's Thomas. T h o m a s. Thank you, sir. And your last name? Gale. G a y l e. Perfect, mister Gale. And your date of birth and the state you're calling from, sir? June 2, 1972. In Florida. Florida. All right. And Mister Gilbert, you are going to search in the marketplace just to verify that you don't have an active health plan here in the marketplace. Are you aware if you have any Medicaid, Medicare, or Va health coverage or. I don't. I don't. I don't. I think I may have. I may have a. I may already have a policy through the marketplace. I'm not sure, but I may. But it doesn't cover. It doesn't cover dental and vision. These guys call me are telling me that I can get dental and vision free. So I'd like to do that. Okay? So right now, all I'm doing is health insurance in my department. I would have to give you a call back for dental. But just to let you know, Mister Gale, this is just my feedback to you as a licensed agent. I'm here in Miami. The name of my insurance agency is Mole insurance. Moll, you have 17 applications in the system. Yeah, I know. That's because these idiots keep calling me every damn day and. Oh, well, you can get extra. You can do this. You can do this. You can do that. So, you know, if they quit calling me 20 times a damn day, I wouldn't have that stuff, you know, I hear you. They keep telling me, oh, well, you can get this. Well, you can get this. Well, you can get this. You know, I'm just gonna start hanging up on them. That's. That's. That's a. That's the deal. No problem. All right. No problem. Your insurance, not mine.
