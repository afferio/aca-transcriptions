    Try to connect you. Thank you for calling the enrollment center at one insurance agency. This is Orlando speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? Speaking with Christopher Junior. Hey, Chris. Christophe, you said? Yes, sir. All right. How you doing, Crystal? Are you looking for health insurance today? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Okay, so, Crystal, I'm going to start recording this call. This call is being recorded. Christopher. My name is Orlando. On behalf of Marl insurance agency, just for the record, today's date is August 22, 2024. 20 07:00 p.m. eastern. And, Crystal, I do need to first search you in the marketplace just to verify you don't have an active health plan. Already enrolled. Do I have your consent and your permission to search you in the marketplace? Yes, you can, sir. Okay. And what is your date of birth? 6263. Six two. And what year? 63. 19 63. Perfect. And the state that you're calling me from? From Florida. From Florida. All right. I'm in Miami. What part of Florida are you from? I'm in Tampa. Okay. All right. On the west coast. All right. So upon searching you on the marketplace, I see that you don't have an active plan, according to my system. So I can definitely help you get started with an application, and then we can review the different health carriers at the end of this call, and then I'll be providing you the phone number to my agency just in case you ever need to reach out to me. The first question I have for you is, before we do proceed, we will be entering your information into the marketplace, which is a health federal system, so your information stays there. They will be asking you for information such as your first name, your phone number, your address, your date of birth, and your Social Security number, because they have to register you. Do you feel comfortable providing that information before moving forward? What, towards you or them? Say again? I'm sorry? With you? With yourself or somebody else? No, this would be for you. You're registering for a health plan. No, I understand that, but I divulge the information to you. Correct. I'm going to be inputting it into the system for you. Correct. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And. And I have you here as Cristobal, last name Corey. C O R R E. Correct. Hello. Hello. Hello.
