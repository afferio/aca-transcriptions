    Hold while I try to connect you. Hello, good morning. How are you? Thank you for calling the enrollment center with marketplace and more insurance agency. My name is Orlando. Are you calling in today looking for a health plan? Yes, sir. All right. How you doing today, sir? Good morning. All right, great. So let's get here started. I'm going to go ahead and start recording this call. This call is being recorded, and this call has been recorded just for quality purposes and monitoring purposes. Today's date, just for the record, is August 23, 2020. 411 40 06:00 p.m. excuse me, am eastern time. And just for the record, my name, sir, is Orlando Rodriguez. My license number is 2079-7253 and may I have your first name and your last name, please? First name? Keith. Last name? Clark. Keith Clark. And your date of birth, sir? Zero one. I mean, yeah. Zero. Zero. 121. 1976. Okay. And what state are you calling me from, sir? Say that again. What state are you calling me from? St. Louis. Missouri. Missouri. All right. How's the weather up there? Well, it's been a lot. I hear you, man. I'm all the way in Miami, Florida, so it's really hot out here. Yep. Yeah, I hear you. So, Keith, I am looking for you here in the marketplace just to make sure you currently don't have a health plan. But I do see that you have already been enrolled with a health plan since March with an agent of record named Oscar Rodriguez. Not sure if you're aware, but they have you in the anthem blue plan here. Yep. Yep. Not sure if you're aware of that or not. No, I'm not aware of it. Yeah. In order for me to fix that, Mister Keith, I can tell you what could be done because it seems like you don't know who the agent is and you didn't know that you had health insurance. I'll tell you the steps. That's up to you if you want to move forward with it and do it. So what we would have to do is we would have to get on the phone with the marketplace, which is a government agency that controls all the health plans. And then they would speak to you and you would tell them, hey, you know, I'm here with Orlando. I didn't even know I had a health plan. I don't know who this other agent is. Moving forward, I want to give Orlando permission and consent to be in charge of my health plan. And then what they can do is they can remove that agent and put me on there. Then they're going to ask you if you want to give me permission just for this phone call or for 365 days, I would tell you to do it for 365 days. That way I don't have to bother you in the future and always get you on the phone with them because it does. The process does take about 15 minutes. The good thing is, once we get this done, we won't have to worry about it for the rest of the year or for the rest of 2025. So I'm not sure if you have some time and we can move forward and do that. Okay, I'm sorry. Let's move forward. Let's move forward. Perfect. And do you have, Keith, a pencil and paper there or a pen and paper so you can write down my information? What? Hold on. Okay. All right. So go ahead and write down my name. My name is Orlando. Orlando? Yes, sir. Orlando. Could you spell it? Yep. O r l a o r l a n d n d o. Correct. Ndo. Okay. Correct. And what I see here that the agent has you, Mister Clark, is. He has you as Keith Clark. Date of birth, 120 119 76. He has it with an email of Keithclark, 50, g as in golf, s as in Sam, t as in tangomail.com. phone number as 314-312-5122 your address, 4451 Forest Park Avenue, 717 St. Louis, Missouri 63108. Correct? Yes. Okay. And I do see the last four of your Social Security here as 4760. I will need that full social, though, when you're ready. Can you go ahead and give me your full Social Security number, please? 4978-4767 beautiful. Perfect. All right, so let's go ahead and start the. Let's go ahead and start the three way here with the marketplace. If we do get disconnected, Mister Trek, I do need you on the phone. We'll get this resolved in 15 minutes. And like I said, I won't bother you for 2024 or 2025 or moving forward. If we do get disconnected, I will call you back from that 561 number. So bear with me here, and let's get the marketplace on the line 1 second. Okay? Thank you, sir. Absolutely. Your feedback is important. This call is being recorded. Please remain on the line after you speak with a representative to complete a brief automated survey. Keith, I'm here. All of our representatives are currently assisting other callers. Please stay on the line and our next available representative will assist you. Your estimated wait time is less than 1 minute. All right, we should be connected with marketplace. My name is Sonia Bennett. How may I help you? Hey, Sonia, how you doing? My name is Orlando Rodriguez, NPM number 2079-7253 I have a new client here on the phone with me. His name is Keith Clark. He's calling me out of Missouri. We were looking for a health plan for him. However, upon searching him in the marketplace, I already realized that he had a health plan with anthem blue under an agent of record, Oscar Rodriguez. And he's not aware that he had a health plan, or he doesn't even know who that agent was. So I explained to him that we would have to get him here on the phone with the marketplace, which is what we're doing now, and to be able to basically be his agent of record. We went over you asking him whether we would have permission for one call for 365 days, and he will authorize us for 365 days, and then that way I can work with him offline to pick a health plan together. Okay. And he's here on the phone with me right now. Okay. Hi, this is Sonia. Can you get your first and last name? Keith Clark. And date of birth? Zero one. 2119 76. And the address? 44 51 foster, apartment seven one seven. Zip code, 63108. What city and state is that? St. Louis, Missouri. Okay, one moment. And you give us permission to talk about your applications, coverage and information with your agent on the line? Ma'am? You give us permission to talk about your application's coverage and information with your agent on the line. Yes, ma'am. And you want to do an authorization for him for 365 days? Yes, ma'am. Okay, and what's the agent's name again? Orlando. What's the last name? I didn't get his last name. Rodriguez. Rodriguez Orlando. All right, I got him in there now, he's authorized on your account so he can have access make any changes or updates for you. All right? Thank you. You're welcome. So, mister Keith, what I'm going to do is I'm going to. I'd like you to stay on the line with me. I mean, it's your choice, but if I prefer for you to stay on the line, I'm going to get with Sonia, she's going to read some protocols over to me and get this squared away, and then you and I will stay on the line together after she hangs up, and then we'll go over the best possible health plan for you here in the marketplace. All right? So just bear with us. Like I said, this is going to take about 1520 minutes, okay, sir? Thank you. You're welcome. All right, and Orlando, do you have the application id that we're going to work on? Yes, I do. The application id is 558-426-0456 now, are we going to have to go through and change the agent of record also, correct? Yes, ma'am. That's the purpose of the call? Yes, ma'am. Okay. All right, Mister Clark, I have some information I have to read. You just have to agree or disagree. This first one is just be aware, anytime we update an application, updates could qualify you for a special enrollment period. It may change how much tax credit you get. It could change your eligibility for coverage through Medicaid. Depending on the updates that are made, premiums, co pays, coinsurance and deductibles could change. Once I do the update, then I'll resubmit it and get a new eligibility notice. And then that tells us what you qualify for and what does change. Excellent. Thank you. Okay. I also need to let you know how we use information to protect your privacy. We use the information you give to see if you're eligible for coverage and if you can get help with the cost. We may check the information you give with other federal agencies and the consumer reporting agency. If the data doesn't match, you may need to send us documents, verify some information, and we may check that information later to make sure it's up to date. Do you agree we can use data from these agencies for you and anyone on the application? Yes, we agree. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Just need to give true answers to all questions. You may need to provide additional proof, and if you don't, you may face penalties that could include loss of coverage. I agree and we understand. All right, I'm just going to review the information we already have on here. You just verify if it's correct. Okay. I have Keith Clark. January 21, 1976. And he is a male? Yes. Correct? Yes. Street address 4451 Forest Park Avenue. Is it unit 717 or apartment 717? Yes, ma'am. Yep. Yes, ma'am. That also your mailing address? Yes. Email looks like keithclark 50 gst@gmail.com. yes or no? Phone number 314512 or, I'm sorry? 314-312-5122 correct? Yes. Okay. And you still want to get paper notices in the mail regarding your application? Let's go with the paper notices. Because upon with me and him choosing a health plan, I'm going to send him an email with the plan details and eligibility form. So, yeah, we'll go with paper notices. That's fine. Okay. All right. And then the aor, is that going to be you? That's going to be under the. No, that's going to be under our principal agency owner. Her name is Karen, and I'll give you her MPN number, and I'll spell out her name if you need to. Okay, last name, Karen is k a r I n I with India, n with November, Karen. So it's with an I, and then the last name is? I'll spell it out for you. S as in sam, a as in apple, g as in golf, a as in apple, s as in sam, t as in tango, e as in elephant, I hyphen or a dash. Then it's g as in golf, u as in uniform, I as in india, e as in elephant, s as in sam, p as in papa, e as in elephant, j as in juliet, and then o as in Oscar. Okay, and the mpN? The MpN is 2097-9642 okay. And keith's the only one getting coverage, correct. His marital status is single, correct? Yeah. And he's going to file a federal tax return, and he don't claim dependents, and nobody can claim him? Correct. He's not the main caretaker of a child, 18 or younger living in the home? No. He's not american Indian, Alaska native, or currently in jail? Not at all. Do you want to skip the optional questions about race, ethnicity, and gender identity? Yes, ma'am. We'll skip that part. The last four of his social 4760. Correct. And his name appears as Keith Clark on his Social Security card? Yes, it does. And he's a us citizen? Correct. Does he have a special health care need, physical disability, or a mental health condition that limits his ability to work, attend school, or take care of his daily needs? At the moment, no. Okay. Does it need help with daily activities or live in a medical facility? No, ma'am. Did he have Medicaid coverage that recently ended? No. Was he denied Medicaid in the last 90 days? Negative. No. All right, income we have for him is about $20,500 for the year, correct? Yep. That's the average around there. And is he currently enrolled in marketplace and I'm sorry, we can go back to the income if we can raise that to 21,000. Okay, sure. Please and thank you. Well, why is this. Doing this now all of a sudden? Hang on a minute. All right? Let me go back out of this and go back in. It's doing something weird. Could it be because I'm in the application? Is that probably why? I know that's happened in the past? Maybe I need to come out of the office. Maybe it could be. Yeah, that might be what? Go ahead. I just exited out of it. Okay, now let's see if this works. Okay. That's right. Yeah. When that happens. Yeah. That's probably because we try to push the application our end and since we're accessing it, it probably interrupts your end. Okay. Now is he enrolled in marketplace already? Yes. Well, he's enrolled in the current plan that he has right now with the anthem. Okay. And he doesn't have an hra. No. No health coverage for a job. No. He did have a valid SCP, though. It would be around the 29 June when I spoke with him. Did he lose health coverage in the last 60 days? Around the 29 June. Okay. And he won't be losing any other health coverage in the next 60 days? No. In the last 60 days, has he gained a dependent through adoption, foster care, court order, moved or was released from jail? No, ma'am. Negative. All right, I have to read some statements. Just agree or disagree. To make it easier to determine eligibility for help paying for coverage in future years. I agree to allow marketplace to use income data, including information from tax returns for the next five years. Marketplace will send me a notice, let me make changes and I can opt out at any time, correct? Yes, I agree. If you're enrolled in marketplace and also found out Medicare coverage, Marketplace will stop the marketplace plan. You'll get a notice before they terminate the coverage in case you need to keep it or make changes. And during the months of overlap, you'd be responsible for paying full cost for the marketplace premium and covered services. Yes, I agree. You must tell the program you'll be enrolled in if information you list on the application changes. You can make changes to the marketplace account or by calling the call center at 1803 182596. A change in information can affect your eligibility. Yes, I agree. And for that he'll be contacting me and I'll update it for him. No problem. And the last one stating that sign in the application under penalty of perjury, which means you provided true answers to all questions. To the best of your knowledge, you may be subject to penalties under federal law if you intentionally provide false information. Yes, I agree. And you have my permission to sign the application digitally as well. All right. Okay. That's going to give him a tax credit of 556 a month, special enrollment period. And we'll use the, we're going to use the full, a full amount as well. Okay. Smoker or non smoker? Non smoker. Okay. And then you all are going to go over the plans? Yeah, we'll go over the plan ourselves. Offline? Absolutely. Okay. Is there anything else I can do for you? I just want to verify that if I just go back in, sometimes I have to. I know I have to refresh the system and then log out. Log back in. I just want to make sure that we can see that the MPN is on there, because if not, it won't let me go into different health options or review different things. Just bear with me. Thank you for your patience. You're welcome. All right, let me see if I can push the application through. Bear with me. It. Yeah, it's blocking. It says CMS can't update the consumer's policy right now. Okay, well, I am showing that Karen is on there as an ALR once I went out of it and come back in. Let me see if I can do it one more time. No, it's not given it to us. Okay, so do you want to try again later, or do you want me to go ahead and go in the enrollment? Yeah, fill in the enrollment. I want to place him, and then I'll get with him offline. There is an ambetter plan for $0 530 subsidy. It's called an expanded bronze with Ambedder on a health deductible of $0 and $45 doctor visits. I like to proceed forward with that plan. Okay. And then maybe if we enroll him in that one, it'll probably give some type of permission to go back in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then choose something different. Okay, let's see here. Keith, just bear with us five more minutes and we'll be through, my friend. Yes, sir. Okay. The ambit or elite bronze, you said? Yes, ma'am. Okay, and I'm guessing you'll be terminating that anthem plan, correct? Yeah. Once this goes through, it'll. It'll automatically terminate that anthem for the end of this month. Okay, perfect. All right, a few more statements, then we'll finish up. All right. You understand you would not be eligible for premium tax credit if you're found eligible for other coverage. If you become eligible for other coverage, you have to contact marketplace to end the coverage and the tax credits. If you don't, when you file taxes at the end of the year, you may have to pay that back. Correct. And because the tax credit is being paid on your behalf, to reduce the cost of coverage, you have to file a federal tax return. If you're married, it has to be jointly. Nobody else can claim you as a dependent. You'll claim as dependent on your tax return all individuals listed on the application as your dependent. If any of the above changes, it may impact the ability to get the tax credits when you file taxes at the end of the year, the IR's does compare income on the tax return with income on the application. If the income on the tax return is lower than what's on the application, you may be eligible to get an additional tax credit amount. But if your income on your tax return is higher, you may owe additional federal tax. I understand and agree. Okay. All right, take about two weeks for the insurance company to get this enrollment, get everything processed. It's got a zero dollar premium. This takes effect September 1, correct. All right, I, okay, so I've got that submitted, so hopefully that'll let you go in there and access it now. All right, let me go ahead and log out and let me log back in. 1 second. Logged out. Log back in last week. Excellent. Now I did it. Okay. Yes. Anything else? No, that'd be all, Mister Keith. Just stay on the line with me and then we'll review the health plans. Ma'am, thank you so much. I appreciate your help. You're welcome. Thank you all for calling. Have a good day. You too. Thank you, Mister Keith, I'll be with you in just a second. Welcome to the marketplace customer experience. All right, Mister Keith, are you there? Yes, sir. All right. Sorry for that painful experience, my friend. But basically now you know, you're all set to go. If you ever have any issues with your health plan or you have any questions, you can always call me. I'm going to be your agent. And the plan that I picked for you was an ambetter health plan. I saw it as a great plan. Let me go over it with you really quick. All right, so what I have here, it's a company called Ambetter. I'm not sure if you've heard of them. Great, great company. The great thing about them, the plan is free. They're applying a $538 subsidy, $0 deductible. The out of pocket expense is a little high, but that comes usually with all marketplace Obamacare plans. As far as your PCP is concerned, if you choose to go to the doctor PCP, the copay, is only dollar 45, which is very low compared to other plans. Your preventive care visit, meaning if you were to go into an urgent care, is only dollar 60, and your preventive care visit is free at no charge. Your hospital stay with a physician is free as well. And I know this doesn't apply to you because you're a male. However, for, well, baby care, there's no charge as well, as far as prescriptions are concerned, your generic drugs are only $3 and your blood work is only dollar 60 as a copay. If you were to visit an emergency room and they subscribe you as an outpatient, many policies, I mean, people pay seven, $800 for. You're only paying $45 if need be, in that sense. So I deem it as probably the best plan possible out there for you at the moment in your zip code. Once again, it's an e bronze with ambetter. Would you like to move forward with that plan? What about dental? Can I go to Dennis? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, sir. So dental? Yeah, dental. I would have to transfer you to a different department within my agency, or I can have one of those agents call you, because this is strictly healthcare. Dental would be a separate plan. In that retrospect, our dental plans, what's great about it, and I can transfer you to another agent. They come as a package with dental vision and hearing in that sense. But this right here with me would only be on the health side for health insurance because I get my mouth fixed. Okay. I can definitely have one of our agents from our agency call you back to review dental plans for the time being, just to finalize here. Um, would you like to enroll in the ambetter health plans here? The what? Would you like to, would you like me to enroll you in the ambetter health plan here? So that's for the dental. That's for the health, sir? Health. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay, perfect. So as the young lady was mentioning on the other line, you're going to receive your id cards in about two weeks. You're also going to go ahead and basically receive your plan details, which is going to describe the plan along with your eligibility form in the mail. And then I'm also going to get that over to you via email. At the end of this call right here, I'm going to be sending you an email, your id cards for your health insurance from ambetter. As she mentioned, they would take about maybe two weeks, two and a half weeks to get over to you. And then as far as the carrier is concerned, your plan is going to be effective on September 1. So as of September 1, you're going to have coverage. If you do have a medical emergency, Mister Clark, something happens to you, you need to go to the emergency room. We canceled the other plan that that other agent had you on, that he had you on anthem basically until the end of August. So what we did is we kept that plan active. So if you have an emergency, you always have healthcare up until the end of the month. And then on September 1, the Ambador plan is automatically going to start and kick in for you. So if you do have an emergency, you call me. You have my phone number. You have my name. Please register it in your phone book or in your contact list in your phone. That way you don't lose it. And the last thing, Mister Clark, that I recommend to you, because I see these situations happen all the time. If another agent calls you on the phone and they're offering you money, they're offering you a tax subsidy. They're offering you money toward your bills, and they tell you, hey, Keith, I can get your money toward the electric bill. I can get you money toward your cell phone bill, toward your light bill. That's not true. All those things are lies. As you see, we all work with the marketplace. They do that, and they tell you that because they don't really care about your health needs. They just want to go ahead and take over the application. And that's not right. So, you know, my recommendation to you is don't put your information out anywhere. If another agent calls you and says, hey, I can get you a health plan with some extra money in the mail, tell him, no, thank you. I'm not interested. I already have an agent. His name is Orlando, and, you know, and I'm here to serve you, man. Any questions that you may have in the future, just give me a call, and we'll take care of that for you. I'm gonna need your number again. Sure. Let me know when you're ready. I'm ready now. Five six one. Is that area code five? Yes, sir. Yep. 336-3636 519 60 519. Correct. That's your personal line, right? That's. That's the agency line. You can always contact me there. It comes to Mike. My extension is 10 one if you need it. If not, you just ask for me. We're a family based agency, and we work directly, as you see, with the marketplace. So you can always just ask for me. And they'll give you. They'll give me the phone, or. Or usually I answer the phone. And like I said, anybody can help you here. But if you need to speak to me directly, you just say, I want to talk to Orlando. They'll put you on hold, transfer the call over to me, and then, you know, you give me your information, and I'll answer any of your questions that you may have. Man, you know, we're here to help people and be a blessing to people as you see, there's a lot of things going on in the industry and, you know, we're glad to have the blessing and the opportunity to be your agent of record for your health plan moving forward. Yeah. Yesterday you said dental was going to be included in its plan. Yeah. I don't think you and I spoke yesterday, mister. Keith clerk. I'm not sure if we did or not. I don't think we spoke. I think this is the first time we've spoken, but dental is something different. I do have your contact information here. I can definitely have one of the agents in the other department that deals with the dental side give you a call and then you guys can discuss dental plans there moving forward. Okay? Thank you. Hand them to give me a call, please. No, no problem. Yes, sir. All right, so I think we're through here. And then once again, just expect those id cards for your health insurance. Congratulations. I mean, you have health insurance. You'll get them in about two weeks. And then if you need anything else, just give me a call. All right? All right. Thank you, Keith. Appreciate it. Bye bye. The caller has disconnected the line. Goodbye.
