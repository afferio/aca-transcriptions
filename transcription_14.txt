Please let the lender to whom you currently make payments or make payments, is it first bank of America, TD Bank, Citigroup, Flagstar, or none of the above? I can understand that question. It's asking, according to your credit profile, because they're trying to verify your identity, you have opened a home equity line of credit type loan around December 2022. Please select the lender to whom you have currently made payments on your payments. Is it first bank, TD Bank, Citigroup, Flagstar, or none of the above? It does not apply. No, none of us. Any of us. Okay, next question. According to the credit profile, you may have opened an auto loan in September 2022. If you do not have such an auto loan, please select none of the above. I'm not sure if you opened up an auto loan with Huntington Bank Volkswagen credit. No, none of the above. Okay. And there's two more questions? I have a car. Okay. And please select the county for the address you provided. I'm guessing it's not green. It's not Williams. It's cuyaoga, correct? Yes. And then using today's date or your current age, how old would you be in five years? Five years? Probably 64. I'll be 59 soon. So you are 65 right now? No, I'm 58 five years late. Five years. I'll be like 63. So 63, correct. Okay. Yes. Let's verify. Now, these are questions that the system automatically asks out of my control, so thank you for your patience there. All right. Everything got approved? Almasan says yes. We're going to look for the best possible health plan for you, and then I'll just be asking you some questions, and you just answer them, and I'll be out of your way in five minutes. Are you currently married? No. Okay. And do you plan to file a tax return in 2024? Excuse me? Do you plan on filing a federal income tax return for 2024? Yes. Okay. And are you claiming any dependence on your taxes? No. Will you be claimed as a dependent on your taxes? No, I don't think so. Okay. And are you a us citizen? Yes. All right, perfect. 1 second. I'm going to skip over the race and ethnicity because they're not mandatory. And are you currently pregnant? No. Okay. And how about for job? Are you currently employed or are you doing, like, some side work here? Do you have a unemployed. Okay. And what is the name of your employer? Favors. I'm sorry, say again? Favors. Just restore. Okay, perfect. And we're gonna put about 21,000, because in the state of Ohio, you need to make about 21,000 in order for you to qualify for health coverage. Is that okay with you? Okay. All right. And then I do have some attachments to read out to you, Alma, and we will be complete here. And then I'm going to give you my phone number. So if you have a pen and paper handy, I'll ask you to get a pen and paper so you can write down my contact information while I read you these attachments. There's six of them, so I'll read for them fairly quickly. If you have any questions concerning them, just let me know, and then we would get your agreement. It says, to make it easier to determine your eligibility for helping to pay for health coverage in future years, I allow the marketplace to use my income data for my tax returns for the next five years. Do you agree? Alma, do you agree? I'm sorry, I'm here. I mean, I'm not home. I'm in the street. So I'm just trying to catch up on you. That's what I'm trying to do. No problem. No problem. I'm almost done and I'll be out of your way. And then we can review the health plans. But I do need your attention and your reply here because these are legal statements that will protect you and protect me, and I'll go through them fairly quickly. I'm going to read through them and stop me. And my name is Orlando. Just ask me, hey, Orlando, if they, you know, let me know what this means and I'll explain it to you fairly quickly. So the first one is to determine your eligibility for helping to pay coverage in future years. I agree to allow the marketplace to use my income data, including information from my tax returns. Do you agree? Should I? Yes. No, no, sorry, if you do. No, not at all. No. That's basically them saying that you're going to follow tax return and they have to ask you for your tax return, that you'll provide the information, but they barely ever do. Next thing is, I understand that I'm not eligible for a premium tax credit if I'm found eligible for other qualifying health coverage like Medicaid, Medicare, the VA, military, or your job based health plan. If you do become eligible for any other health plan, it basically states that you must contact me or the marketplace and we'll cancel that health plan for you. Do you agree? They were talking about a cardinal car. No, that's saying that if you have that, they're going to be applying a premium tax credit. But if you're found eligible for any other health coverage like Medicaid, Medicare, the VA, or a job based health plan, that the marketplace will cancel your coverage. Okay. Do you agree? Yeah. Okay. And the next attestment is, I understand because the premium taxider will be paid on my behalf to reduce the cost of my healthcare coverage, I must follow federal income tax for 2024. And if I'm married at the end of 2024, I must follow joint income tax with my spouse. No one will be able to claim me as a dependent on their tax return. Do you agree? Yes. Perfect. And then two more and we're done. It states, I know I must tell the program I'll be enrolled within 30 days. If any of this information on the application changes, I can call the marketplace or you can call me Alma and I'll give you my phone number at the end of the call and I can up those, update those changes for you. Do you agree? Yes. Okay. And the last one is, I'm signing this application under penalty of perjury, which means all the answers I provided here are true. To the best of my knowledge, I know I may be subject to penalties on their federal law. I intentionally lie. Do you agree and do I have your permission to sign the application on your behalf? Yes. Perfect. And with that being said, alma, I'll be your agent of record for 2024 and 2025. Do you give me that permission to represent you concerning your health insurance? Yes. Perfect. All right, so in your zip code there in Ohio, Alma, for Cleveland, I have a few plans. I have United healthcare, I have ambetter, I have Aetna, and I have Molina. The one that I recommend for you will be the Molina plan. They're applying an dollar 809 tax credit, which makes the plan free. Your deductible is free. And if you were to go to the doctor, the doctor is free at no charge. If you need any drugs, any generic drugs, there's no charge of free. And if you need to go to a specialist, like, let's say, the Ob gyn, or you need to go to a cardiologist or a neurologist or whatever specialist they may be, it's only a $10 copay. That is the best plan that I see. And it's with Molina Healthcare. It's a silver plan. It'll be effective on nine 1 September 1, and you'll get those id cards in the mail in two weeks. Would you like me to proceed with this plan? Sure, I'll give it a try. Okay, perfect. So I'm enrolling you in the Molina silver plan. As I mentioned, it's a zero dollar plan. So congratulations, you have free health insurance, Alma. So you'll be basically getting an email from me with the plan details and the eligibility form in the email. You'll also get those documents in the mail from Molina. Molina is the name of the health insurance. I'm sure you've heard of them. The plan becomes effective on nine 1 September 1, so you'll be active with them. And on the email that you provided me. And I'll go over that email again. I have assm 65 at@hotmail.com no, no, no. Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. It's aism one f one s. Okay, let me go ahead and M as in Mary, correct? Yes, it's an AIF. Okay, perfect. I'll now fix that for you. No worries. So I'll send you. I'll send you that email shortly here with the plan details and eligibility. Form, you're going to get that in the mail from the carrier. Once again, your plan is going to start September 1. So as of September 1, you're going to have health coverage for the rest of the year, and it's also going to automatically enroll into 2025 as well. And then you're going to be getting the id cards in the email. You're going to see a screenshot in the email, and that screenshot is also going to have the phone number for Molina. That way, if you ever need to call them or you have any other questions, you can always contact them directly. Would you like to write down my phone number or at least put it in your phone? Yes, please let me know when you're ready. I am. All right, so my name is Orlando. Like the city of Orlando, Florida. Orlando. O r L a N D O. Orlando. My last name is rodriguez. Okay. All right. And then my phone number is 561. Okay. 363-6519 okay. All right. And anything you need, Alma, concerning your health insurance, I want you to give me a call. In the email, you're going to have my name, the name of my other agents, our agency phone number. You call me and say, orlando, you know, I'm frustrated here. I have a question here. Estono me gusta. This is horrible. Help me here. This is great. I have a question, and we're here to help you at our agency. And Alma, if anybody else calls you, any other agent calls you, just be careful, you know, because I have a lot of clients up in the New York, New Jersey, Ohio area, all the way down to the east coast, that a lot of agents, in order for them to get your application, they start telling you that they'll offer you gift cards, they'll offer you money, they'll pay your utilities, that they'll send you a check in the mail every month to pay your light bill. That's all. That's all false, you know? So if there's any other agent that calls you. But I'm up. Yeah, it's a scam, correct? Tell them. Look, you know what? I'm not interested. I'm already working with a health insurance agent for Obamacare. His name was Orlando. Don't call me anymore, don't give. Because all they care about is just getting the application because we get paid good money for the application, but they're hurting you because. And you're hurting yourself because you're going to have your social, your date of birth, all your information out there. So just know that with, with us, with us, your stuff is going to be safe. An email. And everything in the email is going to have the name of my agency, my phone number, the name of the agents, it's going to have the plan there, etcetera. So you're not going to have any issues. All right? Okay. All right, then when? Alma, it's been a pleasure. And I'll send you that email in the next five minutes, and then we'll be in contact. Thank you so much. If you have any questions or you have any friends or family that need help and need health insurance, you can always shoot them our way. All right. Okay. Well, all right. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. Take care. Bye bye. Okay. Have a good day. Bye. You, too.
