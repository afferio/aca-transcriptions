    While I try to connect you. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for calling Mol insurance enrollment center. Are you looking for a healthcare insurance? Yes. All right, I'm going to need a few things from you. I'm going to need this. Just letting you know that I am going to need your full name, your last name, date of birth, your full address, the state that you live in, and also your Social Security number. Okay. Are you comfortable with that? Yes. Okay, can I please have your first name, sir? Timothy. Your last name? Norton. N o R. T o n. I'm sorry, can you repeat that again? N o r t o n. N o r. T o n. T o n. Norton. Okay. What is your date of birth? Twelve. 962. All right. What state are you in? Located? Georgia. Georgia. Okay. All right. Mister Timothy, I do see here you do have a health care plan. I don't know if you're aware that you do have an insurance coverage. I don't cancel that. And I'm sorry, someone cancel that and get what you're offering. Okay. So for me to do that, I have to call the marketplace with you on the line, and they would have to ask you, and obviously I would have to be authorized to become your agent. Are you okay with that? Do you have the time for that? I really don't. Okay. Then I can't do anything, sir, because you already have an agent, and I won't be able to help you unless you get authorized that for me. Okay.
