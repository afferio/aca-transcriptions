Most of the information on the application will be pre populated, so I would just be reading that information off to you. If the information is correct, you can confirm just by stating yes. And then if there's any information that you would like for me to update, just let me know and I'll make those changes for you. Okay? Okay. All right.

Ma'am, I can't afford it. That's why I'm calling to see if I can get something cheaper. I do have medical bills. I do have to. So the next statements I do have to read to you in full at the end of each one, just state whether you agree. Okay? Okay. All right. So to make it easier to determine my eligibility for help paying for health coverage in future years, I agree to allow the marketplace to use income data, including information from tax returns, for the next five years. The marketplace will send me a notice, let me make any changes, and I can opt out at any time. Yes, I agree. Okay. If anyone on this application enrolls in Medicaid, I'm giving the Medicaid agency the right to pursue and get any money from other health insurance, legal settlements or other third parties. I'm also giving the Medicaid agency rights to pursue and get medical support from a spouse or parent. Yes. And I know I must tell the program I'll be enrolled in if information I listed on this application changes. I know I can make changes in my marketplace account or by calling the Marketplace call center at 1803 182596. I know a change in my information could affect eligibility for members of my household. Yes. And I'm signing this application under penalty of perjury, which means I provided true answers to all the questions. To the best of my knowledge, I know I may be subject to penalties under federal law if I intentionally provide false information. Yes. Okay. Then do you give me permission to electronically sign in, submit the application using your first and last name? Yes, ma'am. All right. Thank you. And then just 1 second as this information submits okay, Miss Smith, before you are potentially eligible to make any changes to your health coverage, the marketplace is going to check to see if you are eligible for Michigan Medicaid. It does show that they have expanded their Medicaid program to individuals between the ages of 19 and 64 who don't have any dependents. So they are going to check to see if you are eligible for their coverage. If you're eligible for their coverage, you'll just continue with the coverage through them. However, if not, then you would need to report any denial here to the health insurance marketplace before we're able to move forward with potentially changing any coverage options for you. Okay, I'm sorry, Candy. Did you have Medicaid? Are you currently enrolled in Medicaid? No, I'm not. Okay, so then why are you, are we gonna put her in a Medicaid if she's not? She just wants, she just wants to be able to look for a better plan. That's why if I can get Medicaid, I'll get Medicaid something cheaper that I don't have to spend a ton of money on checking for financial assistance through the marketplace. The marketplace is also going to check to see if they're eligible for their state Medicaid coverage. And because Michigan has expanded their Medicaid program, the marketplace is going to see if there's a more affordable coverage for her through Michigan Medicaid outside of paying for coverage through the marketplace, because Medicaid can be more affordable. All right, so, Miss Smith, they should be reaching out to you based off of the information that we listed on the application, like your address and your phone number in regards to your eligibility for their coverage. Again, if you are enrolled in their coverage, you'll just want to go ahead and continue with coverage through them. But make sure you contact the marketplace to end the marketplace coverage that's currently active through priority health. And then if again, if not, you can either contact myself or Miss Karen to update the application in regards to any denial for Medicaid coverage before you're able to make that change. Okay, so Medicare will get a hold of me? Yes. They'll use the address, potentially the email address that we use listed there, or any phone number to reach out to you to let you know your status for their coverage. Okay. All right. Now, were there any other questions or concerns that I may be able to assist with today? How long will it be before they try to get a hold of me? Do you have any idea? At most, the longest that it should take is 30 days, but it can be completed sooner than that. They're just reviewing the information on a first come, first served basis. Okay. And you're not going to cancel my coverage until then, right? No, ma'am. Priority health coverage is still active for you. That's still active for you. But again, you will need to contact us here at the marketplace if you do become enrolled in Michigan Medicaid so that we can cancel the marketplace coverage for you. Okay. Now, I have a question. If we wait for her for Medicaid to respond back, can I be the agent of record just in case it doesn't go through or it does, just so that I can be able to go in there and help her? So the agent information is listed on the application. However, that update doesn't take effect until we're able to submit any enrollment. Because she is eligible for, or potentially eligible for Medicaid, it won't allow us to submit any enrollment to update any agent information on the plan. So she will have to recontact the marketplace. You guys can still do the three way call with us here, but because we can't submit any plan information, it'll still have to go through the health insurance marketplace first. All right. Do you have a number that I can call? Are you talking to me, candy? Yes, I'm here. Yeah, I was wanting to know if anybody has a phone number I can call, make sure I get a hold of you or somebody else. Yeah. If you like, I can give you my phone number and you can give me a call and I'll be able to help you if it doesn't go through, and we can do the same thing. Okay. All right. The phone number is 5616 336-365-1965 correct. 1919. Okay. And your name is. Katie, Karen. K a r I n k a r. I don't know why, where I got Katie from. Okay. And. But then they don't call me in 30 days if it don't. We can always. I can always call priority help. Okay. All right, thank you. All right, thanks, ladies. Bye bye. No problem. The caller has disconnected the line. Goodbye.
