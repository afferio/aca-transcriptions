    Hello, good afternoon. Thank you for calling the enrollment center. Are you. Hello? Yeah, hi, good afternoon. Thank you for calling. Molly Insurance enrollment center. Are you looking for a healthcare plan? Yeah. All right, I'm gonna need to ask you a couple of questions, such as your name? What is your first name? Santiago. All right, what is your last name? Serna. Can you spell that for me? Your last name. S E R N A. S e r n a n a. What's your date of birth? April 13, 1992. What year? 1990. 219. 92. Okay. What state are you located in? Arizona. All right. Okay, perfect. All right. I do need to let you know that the marketplace, for me to be able to enroll in the healthcare plan, they're gonna. I am gonna need of you your full name, last name. I also need your date of birth, full address, just as we did right now. And they also require the government plan. They also require your Social Security. Okay? It's not up to me that it's the marketplace. It's Obamacare. That's why. So to continue to get insurance plan, because this is an insurance plan that you're going to get, they do require your Social Security. Where you. Where you from, where you work from. I'm sorry. Um, what is your company? I mean, it was like some guy transfer. No, yeah, I completely understand. Trust me. I don't. I don't blame you. It's more insurance agency, and we work with the. With a healthcare plan. So what we do is enroll people into Obamacare. But since Obamacare is a government issued plan, you guys, everybody has to, obviously, they. You need your Social Security to get a healthcare plan. Hello? Yeah, I heard. Yeah, I understand. I understand. Because we do have clients that unfortunately, you know, they. They've gotten scammed and. But at the end of the call, I do tell them, do not give your information out to anybody because there's offers that they're going to give you a card, they're going to give you this and that. And at the end of the day, that's not true, because we all work under the same umbrella. It's just to lure customers in, and that's not the way we work. What we do is that we enroll people into a health care plan. With Obamacare, we try to find you free health care plan depending on the questions that you need to answer, according to the marketplace, because this is the health insurance that you're applying for. And we are going to try to get you free health care plan, which is Obamacare, under any carrier that you want, whether it's Ambeddr United healthcare Blue Cross Blue shield. We see, according to the information you give us, which suits your needs best. But since it's a government based plan, they do require Social Security. It's totally like, if somebody will get my. What's like the worst that could happen if somebody took my social? Well, um, you know, yet people could do things with it. I mean, you know, honestly, it's not. It's. I'm not gonna stay with your social. This is the marketplace. This is Obamacare. They're the ones that are gonna stay with the Social Security number day. Once we put it into the system, they're no longer going to be able to see your full social. They only see the last four of your social, but they do require for your full social, as we do the application to enroll you into a plan. It's a healthcare plan. And since it's the government, you know, they are going to require your Social Security, and I'm also going to need your income, you know, salary, how much you win, how much you make. I'm sorry, annual salary, income. This is all part of the application for Obamacare. So it's totally up to you. And after this, I will tell you, do not give out your information to anybody else, just so you don't run into any issues. You know what I mean? Because there's people that are going to say, oh, but I could do this, I could do that. No, they can't. We all work under the same umbrella. We all work with the marketplace, with Obamacare, and we just try to find people the best healthcare plans that suits their needs. That's it. I got a call. I'm sorry, because I was just chilling and I got a call of a sudden, but they're offering. Yeah. What they're doing. So they're calling because you probably don't remember. You do remember, but you probably signed up for, like, a free health care plan. You put your information in for something, and they. They saw that you were interested in a healthcare plan, and that's why they called you. And after they call you, they send you your call towards us, we pick up your call and we enroll you into a healthcare plan. We're an agent. I can also give you my agent number so you feel more comfortable. My agent number. I can give you that. My full name. But it's totally up to you. I would just need your consent to be able to be your agent of record to help you get a healthcare plan and move forward with it. It's completely up to you. Like I said, I understand. No, worries. Just know that when you're going to get a health care insurance plan, they are going to require Social Security. Your date of birth, your name, your address, your email, your phone number, what state you live in. That's part of the application process. It's something that the marketplace does ask for it, not us. So it's totally up to you. Yeah, I don't know. Can someone, like, come to my door or something? No, I understand. I completely understand. Unfortunately, that's not how we do it. That's not the way the marketplace does it. The way we do it is that people call in just like you got a call or you signed up somewhere online, whether it was through Facebook, Instagram, whatever it is that you probably signed up to, an ad or you called or you signed up, they got your information, they transfer you to an agent. And that's what we have, an agent number. So these things don't happen. I do have to give you my agent number as well, my full name, and I have to state the date, you know, because these calls are being recorded. So it's not, you know, it's not, it's not that. This is not information that we keep. This is information that the government, the healthcare peaks. This is Obamacare. So whether you get insurance with us or with another person, they're still going to require your Social Security, your full address, your name, your date of birth, and your email. You know, all that information, it has to go in. And then, of course, once you receive a healthcare plan, once you pick whichever one that you want to go with, you'll be getting in the mail, a health care plan card. And that's what you use to go see your doctor, to go see your PCP, etcetera. But we do have to, you know, get consent from you, and we do need your information. It's completely up to you. And your number. Yeah, I'll call. Yeah, yeah, of course I would give you my phone number, the phone number of the agency that you can call and say, hey, my name is Karen, by the way. Hey, Karen. Look, I don't like this plan that you gave me. I think I want to go with another plan. No problem. I'll fix that for you. I'll go into the system and change your plan if you don't like it or if you have any questions or doubt, and then I'll give you, of course, my license number as an agent. So, like that you feel, you know, secure. I normally do that with all my clients because I understand. Trust me, I understand. There's a lot of fraud going on, and that's the last thing I want for my clients as well. I don't want them to give their information out because then, you know, these things happen, and it sucks. Nobody wants that. So it's totally up to you. The number that calls me. Uh huh. If the number that called me, is it the same number as yours or. Because it looks like it's three years. No, my agency number is a different phone number. I can give you that. And then you can, you know, give us a call and say, hey, listen, I want healthcare plan, and we'll be more than happy to help you. That's what we do. We're agents that help people get healthcare plans. Can you send me your number? Yeah, I can give you my number. Do you have a pen and paper? Yeah, let me get up. Let me get it real quick. Okay. Yeah, I don't have pen, but you have a. Do you have a pencil? Or maybe you want to write it down? I'll write it down. The mirror with. Yeah, you got me. Okay. Are you ready? Yeah. All right. It's 561-363-6519 and once again, my name is Karen, and you can give us a call back and just ask for me, or you can speak to any of my colleagues, their agents as well, and we'll be more than happy to help you with your plan. Like I said, I completely understand if you're kind of, like, paranoid because you don't want to give your social. But do remember, you are enrolling for a healthcare plan, and any healthcare provider will ask you for your Social Security number. That is part of the process. Okay. Yeah, I'm going to look up something and then call her. No problem. Okay. All right, thank you. You have a great one. Bye.
