My license number is 2079-7253 today's August 22, 2024. 05:15 p.m. and Lynn, I'm going to search you to see if you have an active health plan in the marketplace. Do I have your permission to conduct that search and become your agent of record? If we can figure out a health plan for you here today. All right, thank you. All right, so I don't see that you have an active health plan. Active right now in the system. Would you like to run an application for me? It'll take me five minutes. And we can decide on a health plan here today? Sure. As long as it's no personal stuff, that's fine. Well, we have to enter your stuff, ma'am, into the marketplace in order for them to be able to identify you. Right. It's a marketplace plan with Obamacare to find you a health plan. So they require all your private information. If not, it's impossible to register you. So that's totally up to you. No, I don't feel right about that. If you send me something in the mail, that's fine. Yeah, I didn't send you anything in the mail. Our agency, we work with CMS. We work with the marketplace, with Obamacare. And what we do is we help individuals who either lost their job, they had a loss qualifying event, they got married, adopted a child, they recently moved, or they're low income and they just need a hand. We help them get qualified with a federal marketplace health plan. We work with all the carriers. Cigna, Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Aetna Ambedar, Oscar Molina, United Healthcare. And based on your zip code and then your income, the system shows us what carriers are available. We review that with you, and then you basically have active healthcare. But it sensed that in order for that to happen, we would have to register you directly with the carrier. And that's what I do as an agent. And then I would be your agent moving forward, and I will give you all my information, my license number, the contact information to my agency as well. And would you like to proceed? Not at this time. Thank you. Okay. Thank you.
