    Try to connect you. Thank you for calling the enrollment center here with the marketplace. My name is Orlando. Are you calling in for health insurance? Yes, sir. All right. Good evening. How are you? All right. All right, and may I have your first name and last name? Yuvaldo Velobos Junior. Can you spell that for me, sir? U b a l d. O U b a l d. Okay, and the last name? Velobos. V I ll a l o b o s. Junior. Junior. Okay, give me 1 second. I'm sorry, because we have to type this into the system, and I'm having a hard time understanding. There was a little bit of reception break. It's vil. V I, Victor. V I ll a L O b o s. Via lobos. Yeah. Via los. Yeah, junior. And your date of birth, sir? 15, 1974. 715 1974, correct. Yeah. And what state are you calling me from? Florida cluster. Florida. Florida. All right. And while, do you currently have health care with the veterans affair, Medicaid, Medicare or the VA? I got some. Don't know, some cheap insurance. I'm trying to find some better. Okay, so you do have an active health plan, but it's not with the marketplace, correct? I don't think it is, yeah. Okay, but you do have health insurance that's in your job or. No, there's just something I caught on a phone, and it's not anything that gets insurance, really. I hear. I hear you. So I do have to verify that you don't have anything in the marketplace. And in order to search, we do need to search you by Social Security number. May I have your social? When you're ready? Two six. 6926-691-0921 all right, let me verify here. Okay, so while the. Upon searching you here in the marketplace with your social, you actually do show up with a plan here, already enrolled in 2024 with active healthcare. So I wouldn't be able to run an application for you because it does show here that you are enrolled. It has you, Ualdo Villalobos junior enrolled with Sarah Ford as a three one with Florida blue. Okay, well, I guess I got. Yeah, I got my car. I think I'm a wallet with me, so I don't even know. I want to use the one time. Okay. Okay, so you do have Florida blue with that agent, Sarah Ford. Do you know who she is or. No. No, I don't. What I could do for you, if you like. And you have the time since you are calling in is. And I do, my name is Orlando, by the way. We're our agency. We work directly with the marketplace. We're based out of Miami, Florida. So I have over 4000 clients and I run into these cases all the time. And one of the ways that we ask that we take over clients is a lot of clients don't know they have health insurance. If they do, they don't know that they have an agent. And when I ask them, do you know who your agent is? They're like, no. I said, okay. So what we would have to do is we'd have to get you on the phone with the marketplace and the marketplace will ask you, you know, Waldo, would you give Orlando Rodriguez the consent and the permission to take over your plan and be your agent? And then what happens is there I give you my phone number. You and I can work together concerning your health plan. So at least, you know, if you have health coverage and then you know who your agent is. Because I think it sucks that you don't know if you have healthcare and it sucks that you don't know who your agent is, you know, and she's making commission off of that. So if you like, I can put you on a three way with the marketplace and we can get that going. And then moving forward, I'll give you my phone number and then we can basically, you know, work together. And if you ever have any help needs, you call me and you say, hey, Orlando, I need this. I need this. I'm in this part of Florida, etcetera. And this is what I want to do. And then we can help you from there. Okay, that sounds good. All right, let's do it. So give me 1 second. I'm going to put them on a three way. Please don't hang up. Do you want to get a pen and paper handy so you can write down my phone number in case we get disconnected? Oh, yeah. Hey, can I get a piece of paper? You got a little piece of a record? I got it right. Where is. Where is Clemmingston, Florida? What part of close to Florida is like 90 miles to Miami? It's right under the big lake. Okay, so you're a little bit up north then, all right. No, I live up under. Up under the big lake of achille. Under. Okay. Miami's like. Miami is 90 miles from there. Okay. Okay. Awesome, man. So my name is Orlando Rodriguez. Okay. My phone. My phone number is five six. 1531-363-3636 519 60 519. Okay, got you. Yeah. Orlando and Ovalo. You speak. You. You speak Spanish? Yep. Yeah. As your agent, please get enough where you're putting your information into. Because the way this lady got your information, man, is you probably filled out like an ad. And when you fill that ad and it asks you for your phone number, and then everybody gets to see your date of birth and your Social Security number, you see what I'm saying? And you can be a victim of identity theft. Make the phone call with the three. Let's do the phone call with the three way. It's a ten minute call. We'll be done and out of the way, and then your information is going to be removed and it's only going to be with our agency. That way nobody else has access to it. Number two, you're going to know the health plan that you have. And number three, you're going to know who your agent is. In this case, it's me. Right? So that's why I want to do that. You know, I can do that for you because I can simply tell you. So I just want to help you to clear all that up for yourself. All right? Okay. All right. Give me 1 second and let me place you on the. On the. On the call with the marketplace. 1 second. Okay. Was that here purposes? This call is being recorded.

We connected together and we were talking. He was looking for healthcare. He had an active health plan as of, I think, march timeframe with Florida Blue under an agent by the name of Sarah Ford. Unfortunately, the sad thing is, he didn't even know he had a health plan and he doesn't know who that agent is. So I pressed to him offline just to be careful where he puts his info in, and that we would do a phone call with the marketplace and he would authorize us to be his agent moving forward, to be able to take over that application, and then, of course, give us the consent for a year on representing him in case we had to call on his behalf and just be able to work with him. Okay, and do you have the application id? Yes, I have the application id as 5569 383 266. And I have Uvaldo here on the phone as well, so you can speak to him. And what is the state?

Yeah, it's believe. It's a united healthcare with an 1800 out of pocket $0 premium, $0 deductible. I saw there. He's going to be using the full amount of the premium tax credit. I see that he qualified for 821, correct? Yeah, we're going to use a full amount so it becomes free for him. Sir, do you consume any tobacco products, like cigarettes? No. No, sir. Nope.

I agree with this statement. To continue, you understand that you're not eligible for a payment tax credit if you are financially for the qualified health coverage, like Medicaid, the children health insurance program, or a job based health plan. You will also understand that if you become eligible for all the qualified health coverage, he must contact the marketplace to end the marketplace covers on the premium tax credit. If you don't, the person who pays taxes and you guys who may need to pay by premium tax credit. Do you agree with the statement? Yes. On his behalf? I agree. Okay, let me use a second. Okay, so I agree with the system. To continue, you understand that because the premium tax credit will be paid on behalf to reduce the cost of your health coverage for other dependents, you must file federal income tax return for the 2024 tax year. If you marry at the end of 2024, you must file a joint income tax return where you expose. Do I suspect that no one else will be able to claim the assay dependent on their 2024 federal income tax? You will be claimed as a dependent on 2024 federal income tax. All individual listed on this application as a dependent who are incurring coverage through this marketplace and whose premium for coverage is paid and hope for by advanced payment of the payment tax credit. If any of the above change, you understand that it may impact the ability to get the premium tax credit. You understand that when you file your turn in full federal income tax return, the Internal Revenue Service IR's will compare the income on your tax return with the income on your application. You understand that if the income on your tax return is lower than the amount of income in your application, you may be eligible to get an additional premium tax credit. On the other hand, if the income is accurate earnings higher than the amount of income you may owe additional federal income tax. Do you agree with above statement? Yes, we agree. Correct? Yeah, give me a second. Let me just confirm that everything is correct. I cash all your cash. Hello, sir. Yep. I'm sorry. The way. I'm just confirming. Okay. Oh, man. Well, just bear with us here, Waldo. Once we. Once we get this through this, we won't have to do this again. This is just a one time thing. Oh, yeah, because I got a lot of people calling me right now. Well, what we can do is if you have to go, you can disconnect off the line and I can call you back when I'm done with the market agent and then we can review the health plans together. You want to do that? Yeah, so I'm already done. Okay, sounds great. Yeah, go ahead and. Go ahead and disconnect since I have the authorization, and I'll call you back as soon as we're done here. Okay, I'm already done already. So everything is good on your application? Okay, everything is good. All right, sounds great. Let me see if I. Let me see if I can push it through with the. With the mp in 1 second. That way I can help him here as far as choosing a health plan for them. 1 second. Hey, I got to go to Bruce's house. No, perfect. It went through. Thank you so much. That'd be all. I'll help him from here on. All right, the plan went through, so I'll be disconnected and I'm going to stay on the phone with Rubaldo. Thank you. Welcome to the Marketplace customer experience survey. Yeah, yeah. Sorry for the. For that long thing, man. It's just part of the process, and that's just to protect your identity. So what we did there is we removed all your information from all over the place, including from that former agent. If you want to go over the health plans really quick, I can go over them for you. What I have here, just for your record, is I have a few carriers. The first carrier being United healthcare. That's the best carrier for you. They have a dollar zero premium, $820 tax subsidy to make it free. The deductible is zero. And then the doctor visits our dollar five and the out of pocket is 1300. Your specialists are $15, and your generic drugs are a dollar. Okay. That's the best plan that I have there. The next one would be Aetna. However, Aetna is a little more price, even though it's free. Your out of pocket is 9400. So my recommendation is to go with that united health plan. That's the best possible health plan in your zip code. Okay. Would you like me to move forward with that United health plan? No, that's good. That's good. Yeah, that's good. Okay, perfect. So I'll be enrolling you here into the Unitedhealth plan. It's a $0 deductible, $820 tax subsidy, free. It costs you free. So that's great. The doctor visits are only $5. Specialist, if you have to go to cardiologist, et cetera, only $15. Your generic drugs are a dollar. It's a United healthcare silver plan. It's going to be effective for you on nine one. So, el primero de Septimbre, September 1, this goes into effect. The carrier is going to send you your id cards in the mail in about two weeks. They're also going to send you two forms, your plan details and your eligibility form. I'm also going to send you all of those documents via email. So look out for my email in the next five minutes. And I have an email of junior 40 9@gmail.com. yep. Okay, so you have my phone number, Waldo. We're basically done, my friend. You got me. All right, no problem, man. If anything you need, I'm a phone call away. God bless you, man. All right. Okay, bye bye. All right, thank you. Bye bye. The caller has disconnected the line. Goodbye.
