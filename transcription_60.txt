Excellent. All right, so let's go ahead and start you off with an application here. 1 second. And how's the weather out there in Louisiana, Eric? It's raining, dude. I'm stuck in the rain. I'm out here in Miami. My friend and I just got stuck with the rain, too. Yeah, you might have to. You might have to move a little quickly here. Okay. It will take me about 15 minutes to do an application. Do you have time? I mean, we are signing off for help. Yeah, we gotta go quick. No problem. Let's do it quickly. Let me hit your date of birth again. 630 63. I'm gonna move fast. All right. All right, here we go. And may I have your Social Security number, please? Yeah. 438-33-9180 excellent.

And the zip code? 70815. Excellent. And that is your mailing address. Perfect. And I need a valid email address because you will receive email correspondence from me at the end of the call.

The carrier will be sending you an eligibility form and your plan details and the id cards in about two weeks, as soon as we pick a health plan here for you. And your income is about 20, 21, 22,000. Well, maybe, I don't know. Shoot. 1516. Okay, I will be placing 21,000, sir, just because in the state of Louisiana, the minimum income that you can earn is 21,000 in order qualify for a college. All right. Yeah. All right, Eric. So upon looking here, it states that you have an ambetter plan as of April with an agent of Blake Odom. Are you aware of that? What is that? Yeah, there's an agent here that signed you up for health insurance with a tax subsidy of $991 that you're gonna have to pay back on your tax return. I'm not sure if you're aware of that or not. No, I don't know anything about it, dude. Okay, so the best thing I can do for you is I would have to put you on a three way with the marketplace, and we can report that as fraudhead. That way, when you do your tax return, it doesn't affect you. And then from there, I can go ahead and choose a health plan for you because I can't register myself as an agent without. Without having the authority to do that. So let me do this fairly quickly. I'll take us five minutes. Man. Somebody. Somebody committed fraud against me. Well, they have all your information here in the system. You know, I can't put myself as the agent on your application because you already have an agent, and that agent's name is Blake Odom. They have you on ambedder since April. And the thing is that the government is giving you a tax credit. You haven't used your health plan, and you're gonna have to pay all that back, not even knowing you had a health agent or a health plan, you know, so I can figure out any of that bad. Exactly. Exactly. So follow my guidance, sir. What you have to do is get on a three way call with the marketplace. My name is Orlando Rodriguez. You're going to let them know that you want me to be your agent. Moving forward, we're going to report that as fraud so it doesn't hit you, and then we'll take over the application. They're going to ask you if you want to give me consensus for one call or one year. I'm going to ask you to please tell them for one year. That way we can always go and make updates and make sure we can safeguard your application for you. If I would have gotten it, I would have gotten all kinds of stuff in the mail, correct? Correct. So let's make that three way call happen. And I didn't get anything. I didn't get nothing in the bail. So let's do that three way call, sir. That way we can fix this for you. It's just a one time thing that we're gonna have to go through today, and you won't have to worry about this for the rest of 2024 and 2025. Okay? And then you'll have $900. I pay $900 on something I don't know and then out. Just follow my lead here. And then what we'll do is I'll be your agent, and then anything concerning healthcare, you're always going to contact me. And at the end of the call, I'm going to go ahead and give you my phone number. But let's get this cleaned up for you so it doesn't affect you. 1 second. Let's go. Quick. Dude, it's raining.

Hello, thank you for calling marketplace. My name is Joshua Gallardo speaking how I help you today. Yes, sir, how are you doing? My name is Orlando Rodriguez. I'm a licensed agent. I have a new client here on the phone with me. His name is Eric Duhandheze. He was basically calling in, looking for health insurance. And upon me getting his consent to search him in the marketplace, we quickly realized that he had an ambetter health plan with another agent. He doesn't know who that agent is. He didn't even know he had that active health plan. And I want to help him out, not only to be his agent and control his health insurance plan, but he's being charged a $991 tax subsidy toward that health plan that he wasn't aware. So we want to report that as fraud. And then we would like to basically, you know, enroll him him and I would talk offline and do the enrollment. But I have him here on the phone. So you can verify his identity? Yes, of course you can bring him over. He's here. I'm here. How are you doing today? Good. Very good. Alrighty. I just need to collect some information from you today, sir. So can I start by getting your first and last name? Yeah. Eric. R I c du hahn. D u h o n. This call is being recorded. Okay, let's give it a few moments. And what is your date of birth? 630. 63. 630. 1963. And finally, can you please confirm the last four numbers of the Social Security number? 9180. Thank you very much. All right, and what state are you calling from? Louisiana. Okay. Alrighty. So today is the reason we're calling because you're trying to report fraud on an application that you did not do. Is that correct? Yeah, I guess I didn't get nothing in the mail. Okay. Yeah. He doesn't recognize that agent of record. His name is Blake Odom. They signed him up for health insurance with a carrier health plan name, ambetterhealth with a $991.76 tax subsidy. And he wasn't aware of that. And, sir, the other thing I'd like you to do is to please confirm the authorization for a 365 on his behalf as well. What is your first and last name? My first name is Orlando. My last name is Rodriguez. Okay, so I'm going to explain how we're going to authorize your agent today, sir, so you can allow Orlando to access your account. To access your account for one call, or it says 365 calendar days. This individual will be able to call the marketplace without you. So how long would you like the authorization for Orlando to last? How long? 365 counter days. Yeah, I guess. Yeah. Eric. So this is something we went over and I ask you to please pay attention to everything that we're asking you. So once again, over, right before connecting this call that the marketplace will be asking you if you would give me authority to call on your behalf and control your health plan, either for one call or one year. We would like to consent for one year. That way we don't have to be doing this call every single time something happens with your health plan. If you have an issue with your health plan, we have the authority to go and represent you and fix whatever it is that needs to be fixed. And that's why you see what? Right. He just said 365 days, brother. That's one year. Okay? Yes, sir. Over. Alberti. So today, the reason we're calling is because you're trying to report fraud on the application here. Is that correct? Yeah. What's the date on that? I want to know the date. Well, what I'm seeing is that the agent on record is called her. His name is Karen Saga Starquist. No, it's not. It's Karen. That is our agency primary owner. I pushed the application for you. The wrong NPN on there that he doesn't recognize is Blake. Karen is the one that we're going to be going through. She's our agency owner. What we're talking about is Blake Odom, NPN 107 187369. He enlisted Eric Duhan with a health plan without his consent and without him even knowing about it. This guy has had health insurance and he's getting charged a tax credit, and he didn't even know. So that's what we need to report. Yeah. And can I please have the date and the date that that started on for you to know on your site is four first, 2024. So on April 1, this has been happening since April. So this is what I want to do for my client. I want to go ahead and revert that whole tax credit so he's not responsible for it in that sense. So we'll report that as fraudhead. And then I'm not sure if you need me to do a new enrollment or you want me to take over the existing application. You know, we can follow your lead there, but I want to solve this one time for him so he doesn't have to deal with this in the future anymore. Okay, let's see here. I see today that he has Ambeddre from Louisiana Healthcare connections. Evergate bronze with a permian tax credit, $991.76. Correct. And it seems today that the coverage started April 1 of 2024. Correct. Okay, so what I'm going to go ahead and do is help you report fraud on the application here. Correct. But make sure it's not being reported under. Karen, be careful there, please. Okay. All right. Because what we did is we tried to push it through that way you can push it through on your side, so you have to be very careful. I don't want my agency being accused of fraud over this application. We're here to help them not get accused of fraud. Yeah. Now I got a question. What's the $921? What is that? I'll explain that to you. Eriche, let him finish that part. It's a tax credit that the government applies toward your health plan. In order to make your health plan free. If you don't want to use the whole credit, you'll have to pay for that. And I can discuss that with you offline. Just let him do his ordeal because if not, we're going to be on the phone with him for like 2 hours and I'll explain all that. No, I got. Right, right, I got you. Okay, you know what? You know what? I'm going to go ahead and disconnect with everything. I think I did fill something out. Thank you, guys. Take care of the call with him and then I'll call you back. You're welcome. Okay. Yeah, I don't want anything at this time. Thank you. The caller has disconnected the line. Goodbye.
