Perfect. So, Labasko, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna sign you up for paper notices in the mail, so you'll be getting the plan details, all the details of the plan and the eligibility form via mail. I'm also going to send you all of that to the email that you just provided to me at the end of the call, along with my contact information. So I'm just going to ask you these questions really quick. Stop me if you need to. If you have any questions, any concerns, my friend, just ask me, and I'll be happy to explain it to you. And that way we get the application out of the way and submit it. First question is, are you currently married? No. Okay. In order to attain coverage through the marketplace, you do have to file a 2024 income tax. So the question is, do you plan to file a federal income tax for 2024? Yes. And do you have any dependents that you're claiming on that tax return? No. Are you going to be claimed as a dependent on that tax return? Yes. Okay. You will be claimed as a dependent? I will, yeah. Okay. You're claiming yourself, or is someone claiming you? I'm claiming myself. Okay, perfect. That's different. All right. And do you live with anyone under the age of 19? No. Okay. And are you a us citizen? Yes. Perfect. Tobacco user? Yes. Okay. Have you smoked tobacco in the last four times in the last six weeks? Yes. Okay. And do you currently earn any income at the moment? Part time worker? Yes. Okay. So in the state of Indiana, the minimum in Indiana is $21,000 a year. In order for you to qualify, you have to earn that income. So what I always tell individuals is, if you're working part time, maybe you're cutting grass for your neighborhood, you know, you're painting your neighbor's wall, whatever extracurricular job tasks you can do to earn 21, the question that I have to legally ask you is, can you at least produce $21,000 a year of income? Yes. Perfect. Thank you. And do you want to place an employer name here? His name is John. And what do you do for him there? I pretty much custodian. Custodian. All right, perfect. Custodian. Just for information, if you do get contacted from the marketplace, just let them know that you're on the way of quitting on smoking because they may reject qualifications for that. And I don't like to see individuals get, you know, disqualified for that. So they ask you, hey, I stopped smoking. All right. All right. That's if you were to get a call from them. So here. Finishing up here. All right, my friend. So I have six attachments to read to you. I need you to agree to all of them to move forward in the application. However, Lavaska, it is your legal right to agree or disagree. If you need me to explain them to you, let me know. I'll get through these six liters in two minutes and I'm out of your way, my friend. And then we can discuss the health plan. First one is to make it easier to determine your eligibility for helping to pay for coverage in future years. You agree to allow the marketplace to use your income data, including tax returns, for the next five years. Do you agree or disagree? I agree. All right, next one is, I understand I'm not eligible for a premium tax credit if I'm found eligible for other qualifying health coverages, such as Medicaid, Medicare, the VA, or a job based health plan. I also understand that if I become eligible for another health coverage plan, I must contact the marketplace to end my current plan. Do you understand and agree? I agree. Okay. And I understand that because a premium tax credit will be paid on my behalf to reduce the cost of health coverage, I must file an income tax for 2024. If I'm married by the end of 2024, I must file a joint income tax with my spouse, and no one will be able to claim me as a dependent on their 2024 tax return. Do you understand and agree? I agree. All right. Two more, my friend, and I'm out of your way. I know I must tell the program I'm enrolled within 30 days that the information listed on this application changes. I can make those changes in the marketplace account by calling the marketplace at 1803 182596. Basically, Ivaskia, I'm going to give you my phone number. You call me, my friend, and I'll make any changes. If you move, if you get married, if you adopt a child, if you have a baby, if you get incarcerated or released from incarceration, if your income changes, whatever change it may be, you're going to have my phone number and you can just contact me. Do you agree? I agree. All right. And the last one is, I'm signing this application under penalty of perjury, which means I provided true answers to all the questions. To the best of my knowledge, I know I'll be subject to penalties under federal law if I intentionally lie or for both information can. Do you agree to that statement? I agree. And do you give me your permission to electronically sign your digital signature on your behalf? I agree. Perfect. Thank you. All right, my friend, let's see what the system brings up for you here. And while the system's loading, just for the record, my name is Orlando Rodriguez Lavaska. Pleasure to get to know you. Do I have your consent to become your agent of record for 2024 and 2025 concerning your health care? Yes. Perfect. All right, my friend. Thank you. All right, so this is. This is what I got, man. In your area in Indiana, the only thing that's populating. So the way these plans work is they work by zip code and they work by your income. So I have three plans. I have ambedder, I have anthem, and I have caresource, which is very well recognized. The ambedder, my friend, I'm not going to go with. The reason is because you're going to have to pay monthly about $27 to $34 a month for a health plan. And I want to be able to qualify you for something for free. I do have a care source plan for $0. However, the deductible is very high. It's $9,400 for the deductible. I think the best plan that suits your needs would be the anthem. Plan on anthem. It's $0 a month, $0 deductible, and your doctor visits are free, no charge. Your generic drugs are free at no charge. And your specialist is only $10. They did apply a $380 subsidy tax credit toward it to make that plan free. And your plan will start on nine, 1 September 1, 2024, from all the options. That's the options that, personally, as my client, I would choose for you to meet your health needs. And it's with anthem blue cross blue shield. Would you like me to enroll you in that one, or would you like to look for something else? No, that sounds great. Okay, perfect. So I am processing the enrollment for you here with anthem blue cross blue shield. It's a silver plan. Csr. Again, a dollar. 380 tax credit, $0.00 deductible. The out of pocket is 1800, which is very low. Your doctor visits free. Specialist, $10, and your generic drugs are free. You should receive lavaskia, your id cards, in the mail in about two weeks or so. I always say seven to ten business days or so. So give it about two weeks, two and a half weeks. You're also going to get the details of the plan and the eligibility form in the mail. And I'm also going to send it to you here via email. And I know you don't have a pen and paper handy, so I'll put all my contact information. It's automatically going to come out in the bottom of the email. The only thing I ask you, my friend, is just take some time, grab that phone number and register it in your phone, and don't lose it, because moving forward, I'm going to be your agent for your health insurance. So if you need any, if you have any questions, you have any frustrations, something, man, just upsets you. You need anything, any concerns, you can always feel free to give me a call and I can help you. And I'm also going to provide the phone number for Blue Cross Blue Shield on there because I'm a sales agent, so they have more information than I do. If I can't help you, I just tell you. Lavaska, you know what, man? I know you're frustrated, but just go call the carrier directly, and of course they can help you with anything. So you're going to have all that information on the email. All right? All right. And then the last thing I ask you, man, is to safeguard your information. It's our responsibility as an agency, as we work with the marketplace to make sure your information is safe with us. If somebody else calls you on the phone, Mandy, or they've been reaching out to you, asking you for your info, please don't give them your info. Don't give them your social, your date of birth, nothing like that. You're going to have people offering you money, you know, check in the mail, money toward utilities, light bill. That's all false, man. You know, just, just tell them you're already working with an agent, that you don't need help and, you know, and we're here to help you, anything you need. All right? All right, my friend. So congrats. September 1. Your health plan is active. And look out for my email in the next five minutes. All right? Lavaska, take care, man. Have a blessed week, brother. Thank you. You, too. Bye bye. All right, bye.
