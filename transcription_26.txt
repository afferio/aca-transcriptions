If anyone in your application is enrolled in the marketplace coverage and is found to find to have Medicare coverage, the marketplace would automatically end their marketplace and coverage. They will get a notice before the marketplace terminates their coverage in case we need to keep it or make any changes. During all the months of overlapping coverage, there is a responsible, they will be responsible to the full cost of the marketplace plan premium. In other words, if you do end up getting Medicare again or you end up getting another type of insurance, you do have to let us know. Okay. Do you agree? Yes, I agree. Awesome. So now it says I'm sending this application under penalty of perjury, which means I have provided true answers to all the questions. To my best of knowledge, I know that I may be subject to penalties under federal law if I intentionally provided false information. Do you agree? Yeah. Okay. This is just to make sure so that if there's any changes that later on come I will ask you to please call me and let me know so that we can help you to make those changes and you won't get into any problems. All right now. All right, sir. So here I see that the best plan that's coming up for you and the zip code that you are located in it is an ambedder standard silver with Walgreens, you have zero monthly premium. Your deductible is zero. You are not going to be charged for your doctor's visit. It's free of charge. No charge. You will not be paying for your doctor's visit. Now, if you do have to go see a specialist, let's say a cardiologist, you will only be paying $10 for that. Your genetic drugs, anything, any medications that your doctor may prescribe to you, it's at no charge. How does that sound for you, sir? May I have generic drugs? I'm sorry, you said generic drug, correct, generic drugs. In other words, that means any medication, you don't pay for nothing. Let's say your doctor says I need to give you a medication for a heart condition. You do not pay for it. Okay, it's, I'm sorry, it won't be generic, would it? Well, it's genetic drug. It's another name that the market that the insurance uses to let you know it's a medication, period, you know? Yeah, I mean, the narrow connection, I mean, is not the real thing, right? No, no, they call up, no, the insurance is called a genetic drug, but they're just, it's another word for prescription. Any prescription that they give you, whether it's a brand or what's not a brand, any prescription that your doctor gives you, you will not be charged for it. It's free. All right. Okay. And your PCP, your doctor's visits are free as well. Okay. All right, so how does that sound to you, sir? It's an am. Better plan. All right, sounds good. Okay. All right, so I'm gonna go to this plan and let me see. All right, I'm gonna be sending you an email. Your, your insurance card will be getting to your mailbox, to the address that you provided from five to seven business days. But either way, I will send you, after I hang up with you, an email with the exact same information that your insurance card will show. I'm going to send you an email. So just in case, if you need it, you have it on your email before receiving the card. All right? All right. All right, mister Manuel, so you're all set. You have your free healthcare plan, you're not going to be paying anything, and your doctor's visit is taken care of, your prescriptions are taken care of. And if you need anything else, Mister Emmanuel, please feel free to contact me. My name is Karen. I also work with another, I work with an agency and we have here our agents that can help you. I will tell you, sir, do not give your information away to anybody. There's a lot of false information that people will tell you. Oh, there's ads that if you signed up here, we'll give you a free gift card. We'll give you food. Free. Free food gift cards. That is, unfortunately, it's incorrect. They do not do that. What's going to happen if you give your information out? Another person in the marketplace is going to take it and expose your information. I don't want that to happen to you. So I'm going to kindly ask you to please do not share your information if they tell you. Oh. But I can get you a better plan. We work under the same umbrella, sir, and they cannot do better than what I just offered you, okay? So please, there's a lot of fraud going on, and I would hate for you to be part of what's happening, you know, with people's information being exposed. So if anybody calls you or you see an app, do not sign up. That is not. That is unfortunately correct. Okay? So let's have any, if you have any changes or if you have any questions, feel free to contact me. I'll be more than happy to help you. And once again, thank you very much. And if you, you need anything else, please just let us know. Okay. All right. I appreciate it. All right, Mr. Manuel, thank you very much. And you have a blessed day. Thank you. And you, too. Thank you. Bye.
